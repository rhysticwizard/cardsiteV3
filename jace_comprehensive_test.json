      "description": "Jace is incredibly intelligent, curious to a fault, and specializes in mental magic, capable of telepathy, clairvoyance, and illusion. Always in control, Jace is a master of mind-reading and memory modification and is a master illusionist. His telepathic powers allow him to manipulate enemy mages by countering their magic or using their spells against them. He can create a telepathic link between multiple allies, allowing them to communicate across long distances. His telepathy can also be used offensively, inducing fatal seizures in his opponents. He is 5'10\" tall and weighs 160lbs. His white facial tattoos were created by the Ravnican Gruul, who took him in as a child. He wears a cloak in his family's blues, sporting a symbol of an elongated ring, open at the bottom, with a circle floating in the middle. The symbol represents a sphinx's collar, which for a long time was the one remaining memory of his home plane. He used illusions for a time to make himself look fitter but stopped doing so after he got in shape on Ixalan, and after de-compleation uses it to cover up the scars and \"plugs\" from his transformation. He has other mundane scars, one on his right ring finger and another that begins on his knuckle and runs stick straight up his arm. He has clearwater blue eyes with a small brown freckle in one. On Bloomburrow, Jace appears as a foxfolk with fur markings matching his tattoos. Jace visualizes his mind as seamless alabaster stone with a warm, simple well at its center. Within the well is a facsimile of Useless Island. The Blind Eternities and others' minds appear to him as endlessly intricate layers of glass, curving and overlapping. Jace is centered in blue mana. When creating spells, Jace's eyes shine bright blue with magic. He usually tries to avoid physical combat. As he planeswalks, he disappears in a complex crisscross pattern of blue light.",

        "===Adolescence=== left|thumb|247x247px|Jace confronts his master Alhammarret Jace was born at Silmot's Crossing on the plane of Vryn. His unique gift of telepathy manifested very early in his life, often to his parents' immense embarrassment. When his block's cart horse Pewter fell ill, Jace created an illusionary double, maintaining it for weeks after the horse's death. Desperate to curb the young man's precocious nature, his father Gav Beleren sought the assistance of the local mage known as Alhammarret. Alhammarret took Jace from his father and allowed him to become his apprentice at age thirteen. Under his tutelage, Jace spent years learning new spells and talents, but most importantly, he began to feel welcome for the first time in memory. It was not to last though. Jace eventually became strong enough to try his talents against his master and learned the shocking truth of his existence. He discovered that his spark had ignited over a year ago, dipping him into the Blind Eternities only for a moment. Alhammarret had lied to him about what had happened, telling him his illusions had backfired and not to concern himself with it. Alhammarret confided in Jace's father about the event, and they agreed to keep the truth from Jace. Jace seethed over this news for days, holding his temper close to his heart until finally, during one of their practice sessions, Jace snapped. He slipped into Alhammarret's mind and unleashed all of his rage and pain at once, destroying his master's mind. Jace fled, assuming he would be wanted everywhere within a hundred miles of his hometown. Ironically, due to Alhammarret's death and his disappearance, Jace was presumed dead alongside his master. Finally, Jace erased his memories, so that he would never have to see his teacher's face again, and feel the weight of what he had done.",

        "Appearance and characteristics": "Jace is incredibly intelligent, curious to a fault, and specializes in mental magic, capable of telepathy, clairvoyance, and illusion. Always in control, Jace is a master of mind-reading and memory modification and is a master illusionist. His telepathic powers allow him to manipulate enemy mages by countering their magic or using their spells against them. He can create a telepathic link between multiple allies, allowing them to communicate across long distances. His telepathy can also be used offensively, inducing fatal seizures in his opponents. He is 5'10\" tall and weighs 160lbs. His white facial tattoos were created by the Ravnican Gruul, who took him in as a child. He wears a cloak in his family's blues, sporting a symbol of an elongated ring, open at the bottom, with a circle floating in the middle. The symbol represents a sphinx's collar, which for a long time was the one remaining memory of his home plane. He used illusions for a time to make himself look fitter but stopped doing so after he got in shape on Ixalan, and after de-compleation uses it to cover up the scars and \"plugs\" from his transformation. He has other mundane scars, one on his right ring finger and another that begins on his knuckle and runs stick straight up his arm. He has clearwater blue eyes with a small brown freckle in one. On Bloomburrow, Jace appears as a foxfolk with fur markings matching his tattoos. Jace visualizes his mind as seamless alabaster stone with a warm, simple well at its center. Within the well is a facsimile of Useless Island. The Blind Eternities and others' minds appear to him as endlessly intricate layers of glass, curving and overlapping. Jace is centered in blue mana. When creating spells, Jace's eyes shine bright blue with magic. He usually tries to avoid physical combat. As he planeswalks, he disappears in a complex crisscross pattern of blue light.",
        "=Personal life=": "Jace plays chess and considers himself good at it. Jace also says memoirs are his favorite book genre because he likes interesting people. While working with the Infinite Consortium on Ravnica, he went by the name Berrim. Jace has had a romantic engagement with Liliana Vess, but their relationship collapsed under the strain of the events of Agents of Artifice. Before becoming the Living Guildpact, he also had a burgeoning relationship with Emmara Tandris, one of his first friends on Ravnica, but she could not bear to share the knowledge of the multiverse and planeswalkers with the Selesnya and asked to have it removed from her mind and with it most of Jace's identity. Finally, Vraska and Jace have been involved since their sojourn on Ixalan.",
        "History": "===Adolescence=== left|thumb|247x247px|Jace confronts his master Alhammarret Jace was born at Silmot's Crossing on the plane of Vryn. His unique gift of telepathy manifested very early in his life, often to his parents' immense embarrassment. When his block's cart horse Pewter fell ill, Jace created an illusionary double, maintaining it for weeks after the horse's death. Desperate to curb the young man's precocious nature, his father Gav Beleren sought the assistance of the local mage known as Alhammarret. Alhammarret took Jace from his father and allowed him to become his apprentice at age thirteen. Under his tutelage, Jace spent years learning new spells and talents, but most importantly, he began to feel welcome for the first time in memory. It was not to last though. Jace eventually became strong enough to try his talents against his master and learned the shocking truth of his existence. He discovered that his spark had ignited over a year ago, dipping him into the Blind Eternities only for a moment. Alhammarret had lied to him about what had happened, telling him his illusions had backfired and not to concern himself with it. Alhammarret confided in Jace's father about the event, and they agreed to keep the truth from Jace. Jace seethed over this news for days, holding his temper close to his heart until finally, during one of their practice sessions, Jace snapped. He slipped into Alhammarret's mind and unleashed all of his rage and pain at once, destroying his master's mind. Jace fled, assuming he would be wanted everywhere within a hundred miles of his hometown. Ironically, due to Alhammarret's death and his disappearance, Jace was presumed dead alongside his master. Finally, Jace erased his memories, so that he would never have to see his teacher's face again, and feel the weight of what he had done.",
        "==Revised origin==": "thumb|250x250px|With his mind shattered from the confrontation with Alhammarret, Jace's spark ignites In a more recent update to Jace's origin, Alhammarret was revealed to be a sphinx who arbitrated between the two warring factions of Vryn. After two years of training, Alhammarret began sending Jace out to gather information. Under the cover of darkness and cloaked by illusions, Jace would sneak into a camp of one of the opposing sides to learn about the army's battle plans. During one of these reconnaissance missions, Jace tried to enter his master's mind, a feat he had never accomplished before. He learned the shocking truth of his existence: his spark had ignited a year ago, dipping him into the Blind Eternities only for a moment. Alhammarret had lied to him about what had happened and had repeatedly wiped the incident from the young man's mind. When Jace finally found out, he began to erase his knowledge to keep it away from the sphinx. Instead, he kept records on paper. Later it turned out that Alhammarret was playing both warring factions against each other by providing them with military intel, and thus keeping his status as arbiter intact. He used Jace as a go-between, to gather information from the Ampryn and the Trovians, deliver it, and learn more just in the delivery. And every time, he'd wiped Jace's memory of it, taken the money for himself, and kept the war going. Eventually, Jace goaded his master into a duel of telepathy. At the cost of much of his mind (and, inadvertently, his memories), he destroyed the Sphinx's mind, rendering Alhammarret unable to breathe. The force of the battle, in combination with the damage done to himself, forced Jace to accidentally planeswalk away, landing himself in the streets of Ravnica.",
        "=''Agents of Artifice''=": "On Ravnica he settled into a comfortable life, living in the upper echelons of society and earning his money through blackmail. He would use his telepathy to learn the secrets of the wealthy and extort money from them for his continued silence. While conducting business, Jace was attacked by creatures summoned by members of the Infinite Consortium. After some brief background research, Jace confronted the Consortium's master Tezzeret and learned that these attacks were, in fact, an \"invitation\" for Jace to join Tezzeret's organization. With some hesitation, Jace agreed and began training with Tezzeret to hone his telepathy for the Consortium's use. At one point, Jace was sent to the abandoned plane of Thunder Junction to investigate the contents of an ancient vault. He was chosen for the task because Tezzeret's master Nicol Bolas feared the vault's contents and Tezzeret was unable to get inside. Reaching inside with his telepathy, he found a childlike presence blocked by a psychic barrier. When he reported his findings to Tezzeret, the elder planeswalker had no interest in exploring further. Jace was partnered with a blademaster by the name of Kallist Rhoka, who by some coincidence looked remarkably like Jace, and together they began to train each other in their specialties between assignments. After a few years, Jace came to realize how badly the Consortium's practices had impacted him and began to feel guilty, ironically, of not feeling any guilt over some of the things he has done in the Consortium's name. Things started to come to a head when a mission to Kamigawa ended spectacularly with the massacre of a Nezumi village. As punishment, Tezzeret savagely beats Jace for failing, though the mission failed through no fault of Jace's. Shortly thereafter, an agent of Nicol Bolas, the original master of the Infinite Consortium and Tezzeret's main rival, contacted Tezzeret over a mining dispute on an unknown plane. Tezzeret scheduled a meeting with the dragon on an Arctic plane and brought Jace along to ensure that Bolas did not attempt to probe Tezzeret's mind. Jace became distracted by the dragon, who held two conversations with them both. Jace's defenses, which were untested, to begin with, failed when Bolas struck. After fleeing for their lives from Bolas's forces, Jace succumbed to frostbite and lost a toe. This was the least of his injuries though, as Tezzeret used his manablade to torture Jace for having failed despite his inexperience and the vast difference between his power and that which Bolas possessed. thumb|244x244px|Jace vs Tezzeret|alt=|left Finally, Jace grew uneasy with Tezzeret's methods and total lust for power, and after refusing a task that went against his very nature, he ultimately fell out of Tezzeret's graces. Jace took Kallist with him and ran to the farthest reaches of Ravnica in hopes of escaping the Consortium's wrath. While trying to lie low, the pair ran into the lovely necromancer Liliana Vess, who flirted endlessly with both of them, finally settling into a torrid affair with Jace. Without Jace's knowledge, and with a heavy heart, Liliana revealed where Jace and Kallist had settled to the Consortium. In a desperate attempt to save both their lives, Jace tried to absorb Kallist's mind and switched bodies with the assassin when it failed. Six months later, \"Jace\" in Kallist's body died and his mind returned to its original body with extreme trauma to Jace's psyche. Liliana took him away to recover and urged him to pursue Tezzeret for his part in Kallist's death. This resulted in Tezzeret and Jace scheming against each other, Tezzeret trying to kill Jace for his insubordination and impudence, and Jace just wanting to be free from Tezzeret and the Consortium finally. Jace turned to Nicol Bolas for help in locating Tezzeret's sanctum, and he and Liliana planned an assault on the artificer's base. Ultimately, the attack failed, Jace was captured, and Liliana's betrayal came to light. Tezzeret spent months constructing an artifact to control Jace's mind without damaging his abilities, all the while having Jace tortured violently by the pyromancer Baltrice. Liliana approached the captured Jace and tried to make him understand the reasons she'd done the things she had. She genuinely cared for him, and she helped Jace escape the prison Tezzeret constructed. Together they again attempted to destroy Tezzeret, wreaking havoc in his base of operations. Ultimately, Jace and the artificer dueled, resulting in Jace wiping Tezzeret's mind clean, leaving the consortium without a leader. Jace made a vow to himself to help Liliana in any way that he could.",
        "=''The Purifying Fire''=": "At some point during Jace's first year working for the Infinite Consortium, he was sent to track down and retrieve a scroll Chandra had stolen from the Sanctum of Stars in Kephalai. However, his mission was to erase all memories of it from the pyromancer's mind, and not just to return the scroll to Kephalai. He tracked her to the monastery of Keral Keep where he confronted the girl. After a short battle, Jace completed his objective and planeswalked away.",
        "=Zendikar=": "thumb|214x214px|Jace is attacked by an Eldrazi Roughly three years after retrieving the Dragon Scroll from Chandra, Jace's interest in it was once more piqued for an unknown reason. With Garruk's \"assistance\", Jace soon decoded the location in the scroll as Zendikar. Shortly thereafter, he followed in Chandra's footsteps, having hired a guide to climb through the mountains of Akoum. Using his skill at illusion to keep himself safe, he and his guide soon encountered the bedraggled Anowon, who attacked Jace and killed his treacherous guide. Subduing Anowon, Jace ripped the information he sought from the vampire's mind and convinced him to replace his guide to the Eye of Ugin. left|thumb|221x221px Upon arriving at the Eye, a wall closed between the two, with Anowon shouting warnings at Jace that fell on deaf ears. What Jace found, much to his surprise, was an immense Dragon fighting Chandra, who was hard-pressed to continue the fight. Jace immediately offered his help but was stunned to find his spells malfunctioning and one of the Hedrons floating about the cave absorbing his magic. Acting upon intuition and things he had gleaned from the scroll that led him here, Jace told Chandra to try and generate fire that could not be seen. With it, the pair defeated Sarkhan, knocking the entire group unconscious. Chandra was the first to awake and pulled Jace to his feet before walking away, leaving Jace to ponder who had manipulated the pair into crossing paths. With Chandra gone, Jace had no reason to stay in the Eye. With his goal accomplished, albeit catastrophically, he wandered the caves and questioned once more how all three walkers came to be in the same place at the appropriate time. Despite his ignorance of the plane and the Eye, Jace couldn't help but notice that something had been set in motion with his involvement. He resolved to inform the sages of Sea Gate at Halimar of this development, but before he could leave the labyrinth, Anowon returned, demanding to know what had happened. Before Jace had a chance to answer, the vampire sage stalked off into the heart of the Eye muttering to himself. With no guide, Jace managed to find a nearby town and acquired a mount to ride. Wasting no time, he began his trek back to the ship to finish his voyage. On the way, an enormous member of the Pathrazer of Ulamog attacked, killing Jace's mount but leaving the mind mage unscathed. Jace arrived at the boat and continued on his way. Two weeks later, Jace stood consulting an archivist at the Lighthouse of Halimar. He learned a bit about the Eldrazi but felt no wiser for the knowledge. He recounted the events of his journey for her and decided to search out where Chandra learned of the scroll. The merfolk archivist begged Jace to return if he learned anything, and Jace walked away saying he would share anything he found.",
        "=Return to Ravnica=": "thumb|234x234px|Jace's Sanctum. After the tumult of the past few years of his life, Jace ignored whatever obligations remained on Ravnica, choosing to just wander for a while. When he returned, the consortium had collapsed without him, but he couldn't seem to bring himself to care. Indeed, despite feeling at home in Ravnica's faceless masses, Jace was haunted by the things he had seen. It was no wonder, then, that when curious symbols and patterns started turning up all over the Tenth District, it was enough to make Jace pause and take note. It was just the distraction he needed. Jace contacted a peer named Kavin, a vedalken, with whom he worked to unwind the puzzle of the mysterious marks and why the Izzet League was interested in them. Unlike his accomplice though, Jace's interest turned to near obsession. He worked feverishly, and fruitlessly, until Emmara took note of his absence and came to check on him. After several pleasantries, she gave Jace a Selesnya Signet and offered Jace a place in the Conclave. He refused, but she still asked for his assistance. Jace was not the only one to have noticed the Izzet's flurry of activity. Unfortunately, the pair had also attracted the attention of House Dimir. Several days after, Jace secretly tracked Ral Zarek and his associates back to the Izzet Guildgate. He was shocked to find Niv-Mizzet himself waiting for Zarek and with his chance slipping through his fingers, he seized the opportunity, making a mental connection with the firemind itself. Jace attained the answers he sought but at the cost of attracting the attention of the dragon. Kavin was not as thrilled with Jace's answers as the young telepath had been. The archivist was insistent they walk away, and reluctantly, Jace agreed, even going so far as to erase the memories of six months' worth of work. Unfortunately, while Jace worked at that, the Cult of Rakdos abducted Emmara. Jace immediately went after them as soon as he awoke, distraught at both the abduction and the sudden gap in his memories. The forces of the Azorius Senate had other plans for him though. Eluding Lavinia and the arresters with the help of Ruric Thar, Jace desperately tried to piece together what had happened and how he could help Emmara. The only clue he had was a small token pointing him to a Rakdos nightclub. After a less than pleasant discourse at the club with the blood witch Exava, Jace escaped the cult and made his way to the Golgari controlled neighborhoods of District Ten, having snatched the location out of the mind of the Rakdos. Following the power of a leyline, Jace encountered Varolz, only to have Emmara save him. While distracted, Mirko Vosk struck. left|thumb|245x245px|Jace research on the Implicit Maze of Azor The vampire gravely wounded Emmara and tried to psychically assault Jace, finding the mage knew nothing of what he had been looking for. The vampire retreated, frustrated that Jace had been one step ahead. After tending their wounds, the pair headed back to Vitu-Ghazi. When they arrived, Emmara was received warmly and Jace with suspicion. Jace was introduced to Emmara's paramour, Captain Calomir. This discovery shook Jace worse than almost everything that had happened to him up until that point. Emmara's abduction had sparked hostility within the conclave, spearheaded by Calomir. Jace, feeling put upon, tried to read the man, only to discover he couldn't. He quickly deduced Calomir wasn't who he said he was, but Jace's suspicions were ill-received, and he was quickly thrown from Conclave territory. Left drifting listlessly, Jace couldn't shake the feeling that Emmara was in danger, as his friend was the only thing important to him in the entirety of Ravnica. So, with few other options, Jace turned to Lavinia, the Azorius lawmage who had been sent to arrest him in the first place. He shared what he knew of the plots the Dimir were weaving, and in exchange, he tried to trade that knowledge for whatever the Azorius knew of what he had forgotten. Unfortunately, Lavinia was not in such a giving mood, and his only lead became the Gruul ogre he had hired to destroy his sanctum. Jace managed to track Ruric Thar down and while trying to discover whatever secret he had uncovered, unintentionally challenged the ogre to combat. Unable to use his magic against the pair, Jace found unexpected empathy from the Gruul warriors watching the fight. Jace tapped into those thoughts and used them to beat the ogre. Having proven himself, Ruric Thar agreed to let Jace search his mind, and the planeswalker found bits of what he was looking for, enough to go on, but at that moment, Exava, leading a riot of her cultists finally tracked him down. The Gruul put themselves in between the cultists and Jace, but he was reluctant to leave them to their fates. He summoned a gigantic illusion of Rakdos himself and commanded the riot back into their territory. Exava was livid, but could not overcome the awe Jace's effigy inspired. However, once they returned, they found the Conclave forces waiting. It was enough to break Jace's concentration and Exava once again managed to corner him. The riot came to an abrupt end as Niv Mizzet made a district-wide announcement, revealing very nearly every secret behind the Implicit Maze Jace had worked so hard to learn again. With the announcement made, Exava prepared to torture Jace, but he was saved at the last moment by Lazav. The shapeshifter ferried him away into the undercity, explaining many of his plans to the telepath before turning him over to the tender ministrations of Mirko Vosk once more. With little choice, he planeswalked away from the Dimir prison, but not before Vosk managed to get the maze route from Jace's mind as he desperately shared it with Emmara. Awakening on Zendikar, Jace considered just leaving it all behind and abandoning Ravnica altogether. An encounter with a kor family changed his mind though, and he determined to help Emmara, so he returned. His first destination was the Forum of Azor, the endpoint of the maze. There, he discovered the Bailiff, a magical being made of law that was bound to the Maze. The construct told him that he was the executor of Azor's judgment and that if the guilds completed the trial, a new Guildpact would be actualized by the most worthy. If they didn't, he would deliver the Supreme Verdict of Azor. With new questions about the maze, he tracked Lavinia to a meeting where Isperia and a disguised Lazav were discussing the Verdict. Isperia told the pair that it was a spell that could destroy all the guilty in a district, and they realized that the Supreme Verdict would be the verdict to the trial of the maze. More determined than ever, Jace made his way to the Transguild Promenade for the starting ceremony. There, he reconnected with Emmara and told her what he had discovered. As soon as the maze began, chaos broke out, but Jace and Emmara managed to make their way through the Selesnyan and Golgari gates, however, upon reaching the Azorius gate, the pair were forced to separate as Lavinia arrested him for his long-overdue transgressions. A special trial was held with Isperia herself acting as judge. Jace explained everything he had discovered and how he intended to help. He pleads guilty, if for nothing else than to hurry the trial along. His penance was community service to help the guild champions to complete the maze. Trying to reach Emmara, he passed through Dimir and Orzhov gates until he found her, fighting Teysa Karlov. He manipulated the Envoy's servants to attack each other, but the plan backfired, causing them to lash out against Teysa, who quickly wiped out her forces. Jace traded the rest of the maze's route for Teysa's delay, leaving her behind and proceeding to the Simic and Izzet gates with Emmara. thumb|271x271px|Jace, the Living Guildpact At the Izzet gate, however, he found Ral Zarek waiting for him. Ral forced Jace to reveal his identity to Emmara, that Jace was a planeswalker as well. The news caused Emmara to lose the trust she had placed in him. Betrayed, Emmara proceeded through the gate, but Ral had no intention of letting Jace cross. He planned to kill the telepath instead. Jace very nearly lost the battle as Ral unleashed the full might of his preparations on the rival planeswalker, only surviving through the quick use of an illusion to lure away the Izzet guildmage. When he reached the Forum of Azor, all the maze-runners were assembled and attacking each other. He managed to stop them momentarily, but Lazav appeared and manipulated the champions into fighting once more. The bailiff appeared and seeing the situation, delivered the Supreme Verdict, which was to give every runner the ability to activate it. Jace connected their ten minds to prevent any from casting the verdict. He had merged their minds, letting them peer directly into each other's minds, but it was unraveling his mind in the process. Fortunately, the bailiff assisted him, easing the burden he had put upon himself. In doing so, the Bailiff had declared Jace the new Guildpact, the mediator who could understand the perspective of each of the guilds. Jace met Emmara some days later. She kissed him as a gesture of gratitude, but she wanted him to erase the memories she had about other worlds and planeswalkers. She could not share that with her guild, and to do her duty, she could have no secrets. Regretfully, Jace granted her request.",
        "=Living as the Guildpact=": "Jace continued his wandering of the planes but spent much of his time rushing back to Ravnica. With Lavinia's help, the office of the guildpact was being maintained, but a threat delivered directly at him forced Jace to pay closer attention. The planeswalker Vraska manipulated Jace into a confrontation, in her bid to gain control of Jace as the Living Guildpact. Jace neutralized Vraska for the moment, but his attention was drawn once more off-world as something Vraska said to him took root. Leaving Lavinia in charge of the office once more, Jace left Ravnica to find what had befallen Garruk Wildspeaker.",
        "=Unfinished Business=": "In his investigation following Vraska's ominous warnings, Jace learned that the corrupted Garruk intended to complete his transformation by returning to the Onakke Temple on Shandalar. Garruk's transformation would turn him into a demon and destroy the plane in the process. Jace realized that this would leave other worlds, including Ravnica, in danger. Jace took steps to hunt down Ob Nixilis on Zendikar to extract the hedron in his head which Nahiri had used to suppress the demonic ex-planeswalker's power. Jace arrived on Shandalar to make preparations for the upcoming battle where Garruk appeared shortly afterward. During the titanic battle, the temple began to crumble around them before Jace succeeded in implanting the hedron in Garruk and halting the curse of the chain veil. However, Jace was still unsure about Garruk's condition following the confrontation and sought him out. Masking himself as Liliana, Jace once more appeared before Garruk. However, the ruse was not effective and Garruk explained that though he was cursed, he enjoyed what he had become and wanted nothing more than to be left alone. With a final warning, Garruk told Jace that if he didn't heed his wishes, he wouldn't escape their next meeting.",
        "=Odd partners=": "Curious about the Living Guildpact that had foiled his plans, Niv-Mizzet assigned Ral Zarek to trace Jace and research his many sudden disappearances. When Ral's co-worker, the Chamberlain Maree came close to exposing the existence of planeswalkers, Jace had to work together with Ral to successfully distract the Firemind. In the process, they discovered another planeswalker who appeared on Ravnica every day at a set time near the Boros Garrison. This was Gideon Jura.",
        "=Battle for Zendikar=": "left|thumb|229x229px|Feeling guilty for the Eldrazi release in Zendikar, Jace returns to the plane to help Trying to fight separate battles on two planes at once -- on Ravnica and Zendikar -- Gideon learned that the hedrons covering Zendikar held some power over the Eldrazi spawn and that these hedrons were connected by leylines. Realizing he couldn't win the Battle for Zendikar on his own, he decided to recruit the master of leylines himself: Jace. After failing to persuade Chandra Nalaar to join them, the pair planeswalked to Zendikar again. There, they found out that Sea Gate had fallen. They arrived in time to rescue several survivors from Sea Gate and escort them to a safe zone. Having found out that Jori En -- Gideon's merfolk friend -- was trapped at Sea Gate, Gideon left to find her and to bring her back to Jace hoping that together they might be able to link Zendikar's leylines with the hedrons to find a way to stop the Eldrazi again. Jace and Jori En figured out that they had to travel to the Eye of Ugin in Akoum because that was where all the leylines connected. On their way there, the two were ambushed by the Eternal Pilgrims, a group of Kor who worshipped Mangeni Ula, their name for Ulamog. Barely escaping the titan itself, Jace and Jori En realized that Ulamog was heading for Sea Gate. They then decided to split up, Jace continuing to Akoum and Jori En heading back to alert Gideon of the coming disaster. Finally arriving at the Eye, Jace found Ugin himself rebuilding the chamber and the hedron network. The Spirit Dragon revealed how the network might be used to again immobilize the Eldrazi titans, but Jace realized that the same trick might instead serve as a first step in killing them. Ignoring Ugin's dire warnings, Jace left the Eye and made his way back to Sea Gate to pass this information on to Gideon. When Ulamog attacked, the Planeswalkers enacted a bold plan. While Gideon's troops and Kiora's forces held the city against this fresh assault, Nissa Revane called on the elemental power of the earth to raise sunken hedrons from the ground and move them into a ring around the Eldrazi titan. Jace activated the hedrons' magic, and Ulamog was trapped! Then everything collapsed. Ob Nixilis appeared, having followed Nissa from Bala Ged. The demon attacked the hedrons and interjected himself in the alignment, stealing the energies flowing within them to reignite his planeswalker's spark. As a final insult to the defenders and the plane itself, Ob Nixilis used his newfound power to coax the second Eldrazi Titan, Kozilek from its hiding spot under the plane's crust. Although Chandra Nalaar had also arrived to help, the defenders were scattering in panic. Earlier, Jace had attempted to direct Nissa to move several hedrons which would enable him to kill Ulamog but she ignored him and attempted to charge the titan herself with Ashaya. However, Kozilek and Ob Nixilis broke the hedron alignment and scattered the defenders. As Nissa fell to Ob Nixilis, he attempted to mentally manipulate the demon to leave but was countered and nearly killed by Ob Nixilis. Gideon attempted to rescue both Jace and Nissa but he too was defeated by the demon planeswalker. Ob Nixilis then took Gideon, Jace, and Nissa prisoner, took them to a cave, and tortured them. However, Chandra Nalaar showed up and freed her friends. Their concerted attack managed to scare the demon away from Zendikar.",
        "=The Gatewatch=": "thumb|210x210px|“For the sake of the Multiverse, I will keep watch.” The four planeswalkers realized that they were helpless against large threats on their own, but that they could stand against just about any force in the Multiverse by working together. Thus they swore an oath to stand together and the Gatewatch was created. Seeing that he was unable to keep his promise to Ugin to neither harm the Eldrazi nor allow them to escape from Zendikar, Jace decided to slay the Titans with the Gatewatch's and Kiora's help. After consulting with Nissa, he described the leyline pattern to her that would bind Kozilek and Ulamog to Zendikar, drawing the bulk of the Titans into the plane so that their energy could be dispersed into Zendikar, killing them in the process. To attract them, the remaining forces of Zendikar's defenders would pose as bait. While the plan worked at first, with Gideon keeping the Eldrazi swarms away from the army, Kiora clearing out any other swarms and Chandra supporting them, once the Eldrazi titans were anchored to Zendikar, their destructive essence threatened to assimilate Zendikar into themselves. Afraid, Kiora tried to persuade Nissa to release the Titans and allow them to flee, but Jace objected. Chandra offered to burn the Titans instead and after preventing Kiora from attacking Nissa, Jace agreed. The pyromancer then connected with the animist, allowing her to channel her pyromantic magic through Zendikar's leylines directly into the Titans. In one brilliant blaze of flame, Ulamog and Kozilek were incinerated and destroyed, leaving only ashes raining from Zendikar's sky.",
        "=Innistrad=": "left|thumb|245x245px|Jace asks Liliana for help in finding Sorin Markov After the defeat of the Eldrazi titans, Jace and his friends were berated by Ugin for killing the ancient creatures. Ugin implied there could be consequences for the multiverse and that Sorin Markov (one of the other original Eldrazi planeswalker opponents) would be less forgiving. After consultation with his friends of the Gatewatch, Jace decided to investigate Sorin's whereabouts on Sorin's homeplane Innistrad, and recruit him as an ally against Nicol Bolas and other interplanar threats. His first stop was Liliana's estate, but she wouldn't or couldn't help him. At Markov Manor he found only death, destruction, and Tamiyo's journal. After studying the journal, he came upon one of the Cryptoliths. Curious about where they might lead, he followed their trail, where he met a seemingly insane woman who rambled about the Drownyard Temple. His attempts to read her mind were not successful, as he was harried by several illusions of himself within his mind. When he reached the Drownyard Temple, he saw nothing. Tamiyo's journal, however, seemed to indicate that the purpose of the cryptoliths that concentrated ley energy there was to relocate a large celestial object near Innistrad to pose as its additional moon. As he saw the undead tending to the Cryptoliths, he began to suspect Liliana of complicity in the fate of Markov Manor. As he saw angels clustering around the site, he heard a buzzing voice within his head that assured him that Liliana was behind this. Feeling betrayed, Jace decided to return to the planeswalker's manor. thumb|253x253px|Jace finds Tamiyo's diary in the ruins of the Markov Mansion.. Still, under the influence of the cryptoliths, he tried to mentally assault Liliana in her mansion, but the Raven Man protected her and tried to convince her to kill him. Liliana, however, refused to, bringing Jace back to his senses by stating that she didn't wish to hurt him anymore. Jace articulated his suspicions, that Liliana was trying to use the redirected mana to free herself of the Chain Veil. During their talk, the maddening influence of the cryptoliths reasserted itself and Jace asked Liliana for directions to Thraben so he could confront Avacyn. In Thraben, Jace met Tamiyo herself. She cured him of the madness, and he persuaded her to face Avacyn with him. Tamiyo was reluctant to destroy Avacyn because the archangel warded the entire plane against unknown evils. They had to confront Avacyn anyway, and almost lost their fight. In the end, Sorin Markov showed up and destroyed his creation. After the last protection of Innistrad had vanished, Jace and Tamiyo witnessed the arrival of the third Eldrazi titan, Emrakul. Jace immediately went to fetch the Gatewatch. With the Gatewatch assembled, they hoped to contain Emrakul in the same way they did the other titans. However, as the leylines were already controlled by the cryptoliths, Nissa could not use the seal that she had used on Zendikar. They decided to try and use two smaller leylines and link them to Chandra to assault Emrakul. thumb|248x248px|After finding Tamiyo's diary, Jace begins to investigate what is happening in Innistrad.|alt=|leftThe plan did not work, because the Gatewatch found themselves under constant assault from Emrakul's corrupted minions and Innistrad's leylines did not obey Nissa in the same way those on Zendikar did. They were saved by Liliana, who arrived with an army of undead that she had raised on the way to Thraben. Despite initial objections from Nissa and Gideon, they came to work together. Under the weight of Emrakul's mental influence, Jace was forced to take the other members of the Gatewatch under his mental protection. Within his mental domain, he witnessed the fears of his friends and eventually came to a chamber of his mind where he was greeted by an angel figure resembling the Zendikari deity Emeria. The figure proved very polite and conversed with him, even challenging him to a match of chess. While Jace won the game, all his figures transformed and turned against his king by the end of the game. Realizing that the Emeria-creature was his attempt to make sense of Emrakul's attempt at communication, Jace fled into another room of his mind, where he met a representation of himself that upheld the spell that protected his friends from the mental assault from the titan. Communicating with the rest of the Gatewatch, Jace combined forces with Nissa and Tamiyo to trap Emrakul in Innistrad's moon, while Gideon and Chandra would keep the other Eldrazi away from them. Though their attempts were fruitful at first, the spell nearly failed until Tamiyo used another spell scroll that managed to seal Emrakul. Later, Jace and Tamiyo met in private. Tamiyo revealed that she had been overtaken by Emrakul when she had cast the second spell, that the spell she had used was not the original that had been written on the scroll, and that Emrakul had wanted to be sealed in the moon. Deeply unsettled, the two parted ways, with Jace pondering what Emrakul's greater plan was.",
        "=Back on Ravnica=": "In the three months that followed, the Gatewatch made their headquarters on Ravnica, within Jace's apartments. Thanks to the aid of Tamiyo, they received an emissary from the Consulate of Kaladesh, the Vedalken Dovin Baan. The Vedalken wanted to hire the Gatewatch to provide protection for an Inventor's Fair that would take place in Ghirapur. Liliana, however, quickly made it clear that the Gatewatch intended to combat other planeswalkers and similar extraplanar threats, not local unrest. Additionally, several influential members of the Azorius Senate of Ravnica had been petrified, leaving Jace to believe that Vraska, a rival planeswalker, could have returned. Meeting at a Rakdos Carnarium with Ral Zarek, the Izzet mage informed him that Project Lightning Bug, despite no longer receiving attention from Niv-Mizzet, still showed when and where a planeswalker entered Ravnica. Ral Zarek told him that Vraska had indeed been on Ravnica, but then planeswalked seemingly into nothing. He warned Jace not to leave Ravnica for some time, only to be interrupted by Liliana Vess, who reported that she had seen Tezzeret on Kaladesh. Jace fetched Gideon and left Ravnica behind.",
        "=Kaladesh=": "On Kaladesh, the Gatewatch, along with their new ally Ajani Goldmane, prepared to intervene in the quicksmithing duel between Tezzeret and Pia Nalaar, Chandra's mother. When the Gatewatch revealed itself and faced Tezzeret and his metallic creations, Jace realized that the whole thing had been arranged, since Tezzeret's mind was protected against his telepathy, meaning that he had anticipated at least his presence. Joining the rest of the Gatewatch in their support of the Renegades, Jace mainly undertook reconnaissance missions and worked with sky pirates to hamper the aether supply of the Consulate. He used his illusions to camouflage Renegade ships and was involved in taking down the Skysovereign by luring skywhales to its location. After Tezzeret was ousted from the plane and Liliana had learned that he had taken his orders from Bolas on Amonkhet, Jace recommended traveling directly to the plane since Bolas was more powerful and smarter than every member of the Gatewatch combined and offering him time to prepare would only decrease their chances to harm him.",

After reaching Naktamun, Jace managed to convince one of the guardians of the Hekma that they were part of the native population, despite their outlandish clothing. Together with Liliana, he discovered a tomb. Inside, Liliana and Jace witnessed the assembly line process of creation of the Anointed out of those who had died in combat, as well as a mural that implied Razaketh's involvement in the afterlife. Learning that Liliana mainly came to Amonkhet to kill the demon, Jace accused her of betraying their trust. As they spoke, Temmet arrived and set the mummies against them after becoming suspicious of their origins. With Jace's aid, the two managed to escape. After the Hour of Revelation had passed, Jace and the rest of the Gatewatch found Liliana under Razaketh's spell. Coming to her aid, he summoned illusions to distract the demon and allowed Liliana to kill the demon. Seeing the chaos and destruction that Bolas's new Eternal army and enslaved gods unleashed upon the people, the Gatewatch knew they had to act immediately. As they faced the dragon, Jace attempted to penetrate Bolas' mind, only to find it strangely resembling the defenses of another being he could not clearly remember. Before he could ponder the implications of this, Bolas mocked the telepath for his presumption and opened his mental defenses enough for Jace to fall into the dragon's mind. Jace's mind was crushed and he instinctively planeswalked away to avoid mind-death.",

Emrakul's memory had been wiped from everyone's minds via magical enchantment, so as he began to recall Emrakul, his memories began erasing themselves. As his mind falls into darkness, Jace instinctively planeswalks away. Jace didn't consciously choose where to go, but his destination was the result of pieces of memory as they fled from his mind. More than anything, it was an instinctive urge to leave that made him get sucked down to one specific very hidden place: Ixalan. When he arrived he had no memory of who or what he was. When he instinctively tried to planeswalk away, he found to his shock that he could not leave. Slowly, surface memories returned to him, although in a confused manner, manifesting as illusions. At first, Jace had no idea what these things were and feared for his sanity until he rediscovered that he had magical talent. Working to sustain himself, the planeswalker managed to construct a raft and leave the island he was stranded on. thumb|311x311px|On board the Belligerent. After several days, he was fished up by Vraska and her crew. When the gorgon realized that he did not know who he was, she spared him. Jace lived with her crew, relearning skills and later aiding Vraska's pirates in a raid against a ship from the Legion of Dusk with his illusions. Slowly, Vraska and Jace began to develop a new relationship, based on a sense of respect and attraction. After The Golden City revealed itself, Vraska and Jace fell in its churning waters. To Vraska's horror, the shock caused Jace's memories partially to return. Even his forgotten memories of his childhood on Vryn and the tutelage under Alhammarret returned, although not his battle on Amonkhet against Bolas. He forgave Vraska for past grievances. As he ascended to the Golden City, Jace learned of the memory of Ugin and a mental command that the Spirit Dragon had laid in his mind in case someone would access the memory of him: forget about him and planeswalk to Ixalan. While he still could not recollect who had read his mind (other than that it was a golden dragon). On reaching the edge of the city, Jace and Vraska witnessed the rise of a gigantic dinosaur. As they walked through the city, they reached a gigantic door, engraved with the symbol of the Azorius Senate. When Jace opened it, he and Vraska beheld the form of Azor, who reminded Jace much of Alhammarret. The ancient parun of the Ravnican guild read Vraska's mind as she prepared to attack him, but Jace managed to block him. Proclaiming himself as the Living Guildpact, Azor referred to him as a \"fail-safe\". From Azor, Jace learned of his plan to imprison Nicol Bolas, with his memories of the dragon finally returning, along with a hint of his plans that centered on Ravnica. On Vraska's urgings, he sentenced Azor to be the caretaker of Useless Island for his meddlings in the affairs of Ixalan and countless other planes, enhanced by the power of his status as Living Guildpact. thumb|204x204px|Vraska allows Jace to seal some of her memories so Bolas doesn't discover his plans|alt=|left Lamenting that the Gatewatch had failed in its intent, Jace shared what he knew with Vraska, who in turn revealed to him her objective.

Jace traveled with the Gatewatch to Ravnica for the final confrontation with Bolas and immediately became trapped there due to Bolas's use of the Immortal Sun. Jace lost the power of the Living Guildpact as soon as Bolas's Planar Bridge opened on the Chamber of the Guildpact, disrupting the leylines that were the foundation of the Guildpact's magic. Alongside many other planeswalkers and Ravnicans, he fought against the Eternals of Bolas' Dreadhorde. During the invasion, the trapped planeswalkers got together with Ravnican leaders to strategize. At Jace's recommendation, they decided to split up into teams to focus on specific tasks. Jace, Jaya, Teferi, and Vivien volunteered to assassinate Liliana. Jace had a lot of conflicting feelings about their mission: rationally, he knew that it was the right thing to do, but he still cared for her and wished that there was a way to help her. When they found Liliana, Teferi warped time around her, slowing her ability to react, defend herself, or strike back at her attackers. This allowed Jaya and Vivien to badly wound her with fire, arrows, and animal spirits, although the Onakke spirits in Liliana's Chain Veil protected her. Nonetheless, they almost succeeded, but Bolas stepped in and saved Liliana by destroying the buildings they were standing on. Fortunately, Teferi saved himself and the other three planeswalkers by slowing their falls. Later, Jace reunited with Vraska. He tried to restore her memories, only to find that they'd already been restored by a Golgari telepath. Vraska confessed that even though she was fully aware of the threat Bolas posed, she still murdered Isperia in a fit of rage, despite knowing that it would help further Bolas' plans. Jace forgave her and promised to get together with her if they made it out of the war alive. Jace witnessed Gideon sacrificing his life to save Liliana. When Chandra tries to kill Liliana (believing she'd killed Gideon), Jace stops her by explaining the situation. After Bolas' defeat, Jace was telepathically contacted by Ugin, who came to take Bolas to the Meditation Realm to prevent him from coming back to life on Ravnica. At Ugin's request, Jace used an illusion to hide the fact that Ugin had taken Bolas' body, concealing Ugin's presence from everyone and making them believe that Bolas' corpse had disintegrated instead. Jace then ordered Saheeli to disable the Immortal Sun (which had been reactivated as part of Gideon's plan to kill Bolas), allowing Ugin to planeswalk away with Bolas' body and allowing Liliana to escape certain death at the hands of the assembled Ravnicans.

Quickly growing frustrated with his desire to intellectually understand Nahiri's artifacts rather than to rush into action, she left again to take her stand against the Kor planeswalker. Feeling he had to fulfill his Gatewatch oath, Jace decided to follow her. After meeting up, they followed Nahiri to the Murasa Skyclave. While climbing up to the skyclave on a thorn ladder, Jace and Nissa witnessed Akiri falling and Nissa managed to save the Kor warrior. Returning to the ground, they saw Nahiri leaving. Jace determined that Nahiri was going to the Singing City. Nissa abandoned Jace in her haste to pursue the lithomancer. Akiri was distrustful of the mythical \"walkers\" but decided to guide Jace to the Singing City anyway. In return, he pointed out the location of Kaza and Orah to her. Deep in the city, Jace found Nahiri, but both were overwhelmed by the city's unsettling and haunting music. Their force was so overwhelming that Jace and Nahiri had to retreat into the Singing City. Barricading the entrance, Nahiri began to collect power from the stones. When Jace tried to persuade her to flee to Ravnica with him, she refused. When she tried to remove him from the equation, Jace turned the tables on her and took control of her mind. Taking the Lithoform Core from Nahiri, he tried to find Nissa to tell her that he would take it to Ravnica to study it. Before he could make his argument, he was caught by Ashaya who took the Core and handed it to Nissa herself. As Nissa held the Core she found that it was an ancient piece of Zendikar's soul that spoke to her, arguing that she could use it to restore Zendikar to power. When Jace tried to take control of her mind, and Nahiri returned with a vengeance, Nissa used the power. Jace witnessed how she flattened the Singing City into dust and restored Zendikar's soil. With Nissa, Jace realized that the Core had served its purpose. It had undone damage to the plane. Zendikar was healing, turning into something healthier, stronger than it was before the battle with the Eldrazi. Though the scars were still there, they were memories now, not their defining features. Nissa left, still feeling betrayed by Jace.

Possessing all of Tezzeret's knowledge about the artificer's life, Jace set a series of traps to try and locate him should he have survived Kamigawa. When Tezzeret stumbled into such a trap upon Esper, Jace was alerted and went there to try and deal with him. Tezzeret got the upper hand, infecting Jace with an etherium device that prevented him from using any of his abilities, but the device was removed by Nicol Bolas later, as part of Tezzeret's plans. Once again free, the artificer and the telepath immediately rekindled their war. Bolas intervened again, unbeknownst to Jace, and sent Tezzeret to Mirrodin. *The proprietary font that's been used from Magic 2015 onward is called Beleren, after Jace. *Jace, the Mind Sculptor is also featured as a card in the Japanese TCG Duel Masters, which is published by Wizards of the Coast as well. *R&D videos for Jace Vryn's Prodigy / Jace Telepath Unbound refer to Jace as the most powerful planeswalker in the Magic Origins set. *In the video game Magic: The Gathering Arena, Jace is voiced by Nolan North. *In contrast to the other compleated planeswalkers and creatures that exhibit characteristics of the color that compleated them, Jace exhibits the physical characteristic of the Phyrexians of his natural color (the Chrome Host's optical tendrils) despite being infected by a member of the Etched Host, Vraska. It is unknown whether this has an in-universe meaning or was an oversight in artistic direction. *Jace received cross-promotional cards in Lord of Vermilion II, Lord of Vermilion Re:2, and Lord of Vermilion III. *Jace appeared on Magic: The Gathering's Hot Pockets promotion, on the Philly Steak & Cheese box. He later appeared on Magic: The Gathering's IHOP promotion, featuring Jace's Illusion Berry Pancakes. *Through his relationship with Vraska, it's implied that gorgons and humans are reproductively isolated.",
