This directory contains images for the MTG Community Hub website.

## Required Images

For the website to display properly, you'll need the following images:

1. `hero-bg.jpg` - Main hero background (recommended size: 1920x1080px)
2. Creator placeholders:
   - `creator-placeholder1.jpg` through `creator-placeholder16.jpg` (recommended size: 400x300px)
