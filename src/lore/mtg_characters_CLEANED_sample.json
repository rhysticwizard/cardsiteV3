At the end of [[New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse]], he was un-[[Compleation|compleated]].\n\n==Appearance and characteristics==\nAjani is a large one-eyed albino [[cat warrior]], torn between his leonin ferocity and his sense of justice. He believes the strong should protect the weak, and that tyrants must be toppled at all costs. He cares for his allies, takes a mentor-like role for them, and does his best to help them through their time of trouble.\n\nHe is a large figure, standing 6'6\"<ref name=\"Baseball\">{{WebRef|url=https://secretlair.wizards.com/us/product/865798/magic-the-baseballing|title=Magic: The Baseballing|author=Scalefast Inc.|date=August 28, 2023|publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] [[Secret Lair]]}}</ref> or 6'3\"<ref name=\"Visual Guide\"/> tall and weighing 250 lbs. He has a strong feline face and white fur covering his entire body.<ref name=\"Repair\"/> His right eye is pale blue, and a scar runs through his left eye socket.<ref name=\"Visual Guide\"/>\n\nAjani's beliefs have evolved over the years. When his spark first manifested (over the loss of his brother), he believed that channeling his rage toward avenging his fallen loved one was the correct path. He let his seething rage drive him forward, ignoring how his actions affected those around him. However, spending time with Elspeth morphed these views and, ultimately with her death, showed him that his fury wasn't the correct path to inner peace.  \n\nHis specialty is magic of the purification of body and soul: spells that heal and strengthen his allies, and spells that evoke the inner, spiritual essence of others.<ref name=\"pw\">{{PWBio|Ajani-Goldmane}}</ref>\n\nAjani is primarily [[white]]-aligned but secondarily [[green]]. He formerly had access to [[red]] mana but lost access to it after learning that rage doesn't bring peace. As Ajani planeswalks, he disappears in a golden light storm.<ref name=\"Forsaken\">[[Greg Weisman]] (November 2019). \"''[[War of the Spark: Forsaken]]''\". Del Rey.</ref>\n\n===Compleated===\nAfter being compleated, he wore a cybernetic eye in place of his blinded eye and had black wires and cables under his skin. The skin on one of his arms was burned away by [[Jaya Ballard]].<ref name=\"Whisper\"/> He wore a suit of metallic red and white armor that appeared to have grown out of his body and carried a massive double-headed axe, the blades reversed in Norn's honor.<ref name=\"Impossible\"/> Though the Mirrans were unable to remove the Phyrexian metal before his uncompleation, the metal was purified during the ritual, turning to gold.<ref name=\"Rhythms\"/>\n\nAs a [[Phyrexian]], Ajani's inherent beliefs and goals were twisted to align with those of his new masters. Under their influence, Ajani felt he was part of a pride once more, welcomed and accepted by a community that valued him. Phyrexia opened his eyes to the danger that \"differences\" could cause. Teamwork, he realized, was about aligning perspectives into a single point of view. By removing differences, everyone could be together as part of a single Phyrexian pride. In Phyrexia, everyone was together and equal. He never realized before becoming part of Phyrexia how much his values aligned with theirs, and he was eager to help his friends by bringing them into the fold.<ref name=\"DMU Legends\">{{DailyRef|feature/legends-youll-find-dominaria-united-2022-09-01|The Legends You'll Find in Dominaria United|[[Roy Graham]]|September 1, 2022}}</ref>\n\nAs a minion of [[Elesh Norn]], Ajani had a habit of quoting passages from the ''Argent Etchings'', the scripture of Norn's Machine Orthodoxy.<ref name=\"Nemesis\">{{WebRef|url=https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/magic-story/the-brothers-war-chapter-3-nemesis|title=The Brothers' War - Chapter 3: Nemesis|author=[[Reinhardt Suarez]]|date=October 25, 2022|publisher=Magicthegathering.com}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Mortal life===\n[[File:AjaniJazal.jpg|thumb|left|Ajani and Jazal.]]\nAjani was born as an albino [[Cat#Nacatl|Nacatl]], a stigma among his people described as \"white as death,\" and so spent much of his youth as an outcast. At some point, he lost his left eye to the dangers of Naya.<ref name=\"Visual Guide\"/> It is unknown what happened to Ajani's parents, but it appears the only one to care for him was his older brother [[Jazal]]. Jazal gained a great deal of prestige among his peers despite Ajani's status among the pride, and soon Jazal rose to kha of the Qasal Valley pride. Jazal accepted the position in hopes that Ajani would be accepted and honored as he had been. However, Ajani was barely tolerated, a fact that Ajani eventually came to accept as appropriate treatment. However, Ajani had at least one friend, the tribe shaman [[Zaliki]].\n\nAjani was unique among his kin, not only for his bone-white fur but also due to his unique abilities to manipulate the various magics of the soul. He could see deep into other beings, and see the very essence of their spirits. He could call that essence forth and manifest it in a multitude of ways and, despite his pariah status, he was considered the best healer in his tribe. This earned him none of the prestige that Jazal thought it should, but Ajani once more just accepted that as his self-worth to keep trouble from his brother.\n\n[[File:AjaniSpark.jpg|thumb|Ajani's [[Planeswalker's spark|spark]] ignites.]]\nAs the Festival of [[Marisi]], the annual celebration of the [[Breaking of the Coil]] neared, Ajani was attacked by a group of humans, an unusual event in itself, but foreboding as Jazal discovered that they had been sent after Ajani himself, and not merely the Nacatl.<ref name=\"Shakers\">{{WebRef|url=https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/savor-flavor/movers-and-shakers-naya-2008-11-05|title=The Movers and Shakers of Naya|author=[[Doug Beyer]]|date=November 5, 2008|work=[[magicthegathering.com]]|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20210122230247/https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/savor-flavor/movers-and-shakers-naya-2008-11-05|archivedate=2021-01-22}}</ref> Ajani sought to repay his brother for his heroic defense and began a hunt for the feast celebration. Secretly he was hoping to gain the pride's respect, but when he brought down a <c>Godsire</c> his kill was stolen by the worst of his persecutors, [[Tenoch]]. Ajani was savagely beaten by the rival leonin, a punishment that escalated after the white cat clumsily revealed his ability to see into the souls of others. He was left to drag himself back to the feast, keeping his peace for the sake of his brother and the tribe.\n\nThat night, after the revelries had died down, a dark figure stole through the sleeping pride. They dropped a vessel of dark magic into the fire and shades burst forth to attack the tribe. During the attack, Jazal was slain in his lair with his black axe, the dark twin to Ajani's own. Gripping Jazal's body, Ajani heard Jazal's voice and when he opened his eye, he was no longer on [[Naya]].<ref name=\"Flight of the White Cat\">{{WebRef|url=https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/flight-white-cat-2008-10-08|title=Flight of the White Cat|author=[[Brady Dommermuth]]|date=October 8, 2008|work=[[magicthegathering.com]]|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404194009/https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/flight-white-cat-2008-10-08|archivedate=2019-04-04}}</ref>\n\n===Alara unbroken===\n[[File:Ajani Vengeant 2.jpg|left|thumb|272x272px|alt=|Ajani seeks revenge for his brother's death]]\nAjani found himself on [[Jund]] where he met [[Sarkhan Vol]], who protected him from the [[dragon]] [[Karrthus]] and listened to the neophyte walker recount his tale.<ref name=\"Unbroken\">[[Doug Beyer]] (2009), \"''[[Alara Unbroken]]''\", [[Wizards of the Coast]]</ref> Sarkhan advised him to take hold of his anger and use it, to use his newfound gift as a walker to track down his brother's murderer and showed him how to planeswalk back to Naya. He found himself wandering the Qasali Valley, eventually finding his way to the ruins of Antali where he encountered a strange apparition that set him on his quest for vengeance.\n[[File:Ajani's Last Stand.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Ajani interrupts Nicol Bolas' plans in Alara]]\nBack in Jazal's lair, he found the remnants of his brother's axe. He used the other axe head to create a new weapon that symbolized his plans for revenge. Of Jazal's body, there was no trace aside from the blood scattered all across the floor. He found what had become of Jazal in the pride center, where Jazal had been cremated. He spread Jazal's ashes across his body, and stalked off to confront Tenoch, suspecting him responsible for a mysterious object found in the fire. He found Tenoch overlooking a cliff and after a brief argument, in which Tenoch admitted he respected Ajani, Ajani threatened the other Nacatl by dangling him over the cliff edge. As Ajani let go, Tenoch dragged him over the ledge. Tenoch's clothing snagged on the cliff, and although Ajani grabbed hold of his foot, the rival leonin dislodged him. Taking serious injuries in the fall, and with no other option, he vanished into the Blind Eternities.\n\nAjani woke up in the care of [[Elspeth Tirel]] on [[Bant]]. After two weeks and the ministrations of the Bant balmgivers, Ajani left after warning Elspeth of the coming conflict. When he returned to Naya, he confronted Tenoch's mother, who revealed that Marisi had something to do with the attack on the pride. While confronting the legendary hero, they were interrupted by [[Mayael]] and Marisi pointed Ajani to seek the dragon [[Nicol Bolas]]. Knowing of only one place to find dragons, Ajani began a walk to Jund... only to find that Jund no longer existed. The Conflux had begun.\n\nAfter a rough landing, Ajani found himself in the presence of [[Kresh]] and Clan Nel Toth who swore to help Ajani find his vengeance and slay the dragon. A lengthy sojourn took them to the borders of [[Grixis]] where Kresh settled his grudge against Rakka-Mar, though it was Ajani who finished her off with a bolt of rage. To Ajani's surprise, Zaliki and Mayael found him on the edge of Grixis and looked to him to lead them against a horde of dragons led by Sarkhan Vol. During this important crux, Ajani finally found Jazal's murderer. Zaliki was the one responsible for his brother's death but had been manipulated into doing so by Marisi. As Marisi had been slain by Zaliki, Ajani's quest for revenge would go unanswered, except that Bolas chose that moment to confront the assembled armies. In front of all the armies of Naya and Jund, Bolas consumed the mana of the Maelstrom, and in a desperate attempt to stop Bolas, Ajani severed everyone's mana bonds and absorbed the last tiny bit of the Maelstrom that Bolas hadn't. Using that power, he called up an effigy of Bolas's soul and used it to banish Bolas from Alara.\n\nIn the aftermath of the conflux wars, Ajani was offered the position of Kha and the respect of his entire pride, the one thing he had desired above all else. He was not the same being that he had been through and chose to leave Naya instead, entrusting Zaliki with the responsibilities of being the Kha.\n\nEver after, Ajani was never left out of Bolas's plans. He'd devise special stratagems to occupy the leonin while Bolas's other schemes progressed. The battle during the conflux of Alara had inspired a hesitancy in Bolas that he had for few others.<ref>{{WebRef|url=https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/magic-story/the-brothers-war-chapter-3-nemesis|title=The Brothers' War - Chapter 3: Nemesis|author=[[Reinhardt Suarez]]|date=October 25, 2022|publisher=Magicthegathering.com}}</ref>\n\n===Ajani's debt===\n[[File:Ajani's debt.jpg|thumb|212x212px|Ajani's debt]]\nSometime after the conflux, Ajani once again sought out Elspeth, starting with those who last saw her. He finally found the errant knight in the gladiator pits of [[Urborg]] facing off against another heavily armored [[Koth|planeswalker]]. Ajani stopped Elspeth from delivering a death blow when she saw a [[phyrexia|symbol]] on the other walker's arm. He escorted her back to her residence and beseeched her to return, that she could do more good on Alara than fighting for the money in the pits, treating herself so badly. She rebuked his offer, stating that it was pointless and that eventually, Grixis would overrun Bant's golden plains, that Bant itself was already gone.\n\nDismayed, Ajani acquiesced to her refusal, stating simply that her lack of hope saddened him. As a final kindness, before his departure, Ajani returned Elspeth's armor, which she had left on Bant.<ref name=\"Gathering Forces\">[[Jenna Helland]] (2010), \"''[[Gathering Forces]]''\", [[Wizards of the Coast]]</ref>\n\n===Journey to Theros===\n[[File:Solidarity of Heroes.jpg|left|thumb|241x241px|Ajani helps Elspeth on his journey to defeat Xenagos]]\nAfter some time, Ajani found he could not bear to leave Elspeth to pursue her destructive behavior and so he tracked her to the plane of [[Theros]]. He had been here before and was well acquainted with [[Brimaz]], who to his surprise had risen to become king. Around the campfires, he learned much of what had been going on, including Elspeth's role in what had happened and the injustice done to her. As a favor to him, Brimaz ordered his warriors to find her and after a brief search, the pair were reunited at Tethmos.\n\nAjani could see that her trials had badly hurt her, but he could not get her to speak of what had happened. Instead, she swore they would set things right, and Ajani agreed to stay at her side. To do so, they would have to travel to the mysterious temple of [[Kruphix]] at the edge of the world. They traveled by river from the Nessian forest to the Siren's Shipyard, seeking the legendary mariner Callephe. Standing amidst the shattered wreckage of ships, Ajani called up the legendary sunken ship known as ''The Monsoon'', and to their surprise, Callephe appeared as soon as her ship had risen from the deep.\n[[File:Ajani elspeth death.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Ajani mourns the death of his friend Elspeth]]\nShe agreed to take them to the edge of the world, but that turned out to be a lie. [[Kiora]] revealed her deception as soon as they reached the sunken city of Arixmethes. [[Thassa]] confronted them, intending to deal with the lying merfolk, but not before sending the pair on their way, wishing them luck. They arrived at the edge of the world, and the god [[Kruphix]] allowed them to pass to the gateway of Nykthos, the shrine of Nyx. To gain entry to Nyx, one of them had to undergo an ordeal sent from the gods, and Ajani urged Elspeth to take Thassa's ordeal, but she pulled away from him at the last moment and gained entry from [[Erebos]]. He cursed his friend as a fool but set to the task at hand. They confronted [[Xenagos]] and the pair battled the god until at last Elspeth struck him down. However, the battle had taken its toll, and Nylea warned the pair that they must escape before Erebos or [[Heliod]] found them. They nearly escaped before Heliod appeared and used [[Godsend|her weapon]] to murder Elspeth. Ajani took his dying friend back to Theros and prepared to fight the agents of Erebos that were coming to claim his friend, but Brimaz's warriors ambushed him, pulling him away for his good as his friend died.\n\nAjani woke up back in Tethmos, where Theros' leonin healed him. After sparring with Brimaz, Ajani, unsure of what to do next, decided to find a cause to fight for. He remembered how Heliod struck down Elspeth and decided to make people stop believing in him. He traveled to Heliod's temple in Meletis, where he reveals Heliod's murder of Elspeth. Once his message of turning away from the gods had taken hold, Ajani returned to Oreskos. There he told his message to Brimaz and the dozen or so leonin present that the gods are creations of belief. With that, he earned his place amongst the leonin of Theros.<ref>{{WebRef|url=https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/ajanis-vengeance-2014-07-23|title=Ajani's Vengeance|author=[[Tom LaPille]]|date=July 23, 2014|work=[[magicthegathering.com]]|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20201021225215/https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/ajanis-vengeance-2014-07-23|archivedate=2020-10-21}}</ref> Ajani now wears Elspeth's cloak to honor her memory.<ref>{{EzTumblr|http://dougbeyermtg.tumblr.com/post/90161316989/is-that-elspeths-cloak-that-ajani-is-wearing-my|title=Is that Elspeth's cloak that Ajani is wearing?|June 28, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{DailyRef|feature/checking-planeswalkers-2015-2015-08-19|Checking in on the Planeswalkers (2015)|[[Mel Li]]|August 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Kaladesh===\n[[File:Oath of Ajani.jpg|thumb|214x214px|<c>Oath of Ajani</c> - ''“Until all have found their place, I will keep watch.”'']]\n[[File:Ajani Impeccable.jpg|left|thumb|216x216px|Ajani fights alongside the Renegades]]\nAjani left Theros, assured that his words had taken root enough to grow without him. He planeswalked from [[Kamigawa]] to the house of his old companion [[Tamiyo]]. Ajani stayed with her to mourn Elspeth's fate, to heal amidst the company of friends. During his stay, he learned of the crimes of [[Tezzeret]]'s [[Infinite Consortium]] on Kamigawa and also informed Tamiyo that Elspeth had seen Tezzeret alive on [[New Phyrexia (plane)|New Phyrexia]]. Ajani prepared to track him down and bring him to justice. \n\nAfter a month, the leonin had learned that Tezzeret had assumed a position on the plane of [[Kaladesh (plane)|Kaladesh]]. On Kaladesh, Ajani established contact with the [[Renegades]] with [[Pia Nalaar|Renegade Prime]] and Oviya Pashiri. Upon arriving at Oviya's home, he learned that she had been taken into custody for being a Renegade. Meeting with the Renegade agent \"Shadowblayde\", an elven lifesmith, Ajani learned where Renegade Prime had been captured and of Tezzeret's involvement. The Renegades tracked Oviya to the Dhund, where Ajani found a cell filled with poisonous gas. Scaring the guardsman away, he forced the chamber door open, finding Oviya as well as [[Nissa]] and [[Chandra]]. The four quickly escaped before any more guards could arrive.<ref name=\"Release\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/release-2016-10-05|Release|[[Chris L'Etoile]]|October 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter the events of the Consulate crackdown, Ajani continued to aid the Renegades. Following Chandra's duel with Baral in the streets of Ghirapur, he took great care in healing Oviya and Chandra's injuries, as both had been critically wounded in the battle.<ref name=\"Burn\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/burn|Burn|[[Chris L'Etoile]]|January 4, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOnce the Renegades had secured victory in the Revolt and brought sweeping change to the Consulate, Ajani found it an honor to be welcomed into the ranks of [[the Gatewatch]]. He took his oath for protecting the innocent from tyrants and helping all beings find their place. Though he now stood among them, Ajani objected to the Gatewatch's plans to immediately confront Nicol Bolas on the plane of Amonkhet. He pleaded with them to reconsider and wait for more allies, citing the possible collateral damage and Bolas' immense potential for advantage at the seat of his power.<ref name=\"Renewal\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/renewal-2017-02-01|Renewal|[[Mel Li]], [[Kelly Digges]], [[Alison Luhrs]], [[Doug Beyer]] and [[Chris L'Etoile]]|February 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Dominaria===\nAjani asked the Gatewatch to regroup on [[Dominaria (plane)|Dominaria]] and recruited [[Jhoira]] and her [[Weatherlight crew]] to help in an undisclosed venture.

Alongside many other planeswalkers and Ravnicans, he fought against the [[Eternal]]s of Bolas' [[Dreadhorde]].<ref name=\"Weisman Ravnica novel\">[[Greg Weisman]] (April 2019). \"''[[War of the Spark: Ravnica]]''\".

At Jace's recommendation, they decided to split up into teams to focus on specific tasks. Ajani, [[Huatli]], [[Jiang Yanggu]], and [[Mu Yanling]] volunteered to help protect and rescue civilians. With the help of [[Vraska]] and the [[Golgari Swarm]], they were able to evacuate many civilians to the tunnels beneath the city, where they would be safe from the Dreadhorde.\n\nAjani survived the battle and was present during the <c>Planewide Celebration</c> that followed.

When [[Ravidel]] appeared at the gathering and threatened them with the [[Golgothian Sylex]], he agreed not to interfere with Ravidel's plans, but Ravidel cast a spell anyway preventing him from using his planeswalker powers.  In 1281 by the [[Reckoning of the Sages of Minorad]], he and [[Caliphear the Nightmare]] destroyed the wizard [[Coldraith]], who accidentally removed Ravidel's curse. To repay Caliphear, he agreed to be her slave for ten years. However, he joined [[Jared Carthalion]] and [[Kristina of the Woods]] in opposing Ravidel and seeking to destroy the Golgothian Sylex only ten months after Coldraith was killed. With Jared, Kristina and Caliphear, Altair battled Ravidel at the [[Dueling Chasm of Golthonor]], and was reportedly killed, having served the nightmare for ten months just before the [[Activation of the Mox Beacon]].<ref name=\"Wayfarer\">Jeff Gomez (1995). \"'[[Wayfarer]]''\".

At one point, Tovolar urged Arlinn to join in the slaughter of a group of foresters in order to prove her mettle as a werewolf. Arlinn rejected that idea and fought Tovolar, leaving lasting scars on them both. After this confrontation, Arlinn abandoned Tovolar and his pack.<ref name=\"Harvestide\" /> Thereafter, she always fought against the change and used [[Avacyn]]ian [[charms]], prayers, and fasting to ward it off as much as possible. She even studied magic in the [[Church of Avacyn]], while successfully hiding her curse from her teachers and mentors. The same day that she became an Archmage of Goldnight she and her peers were confronted by a horde of [[devil]]s at [[Havengul]]. While fighting, she couldn't contain the change any longer and she killed devils, several hierarchs and an [[angel]] alike before her [[planeswalker's spark|spark]] [[Igniting|ignited]] and she found herself rampaging through the woods of another [[plane]].<ref group=\"retcon\">In the \"Motives of the Wolf\" it is implied that the event happened differently, after she killed her childhood friend Luciana in her room.</ref>\n\nTo her horror, she regained her senses in the morning—but not her human form. For better or worse, the experience of retaining her human mind in [[wolf]] form gave her a new appreciation for the wild spirit that shared her body. The only way she could return to her human form was to planeswalk back to Innistrad, but without the influence of [[Moon of Innistrad|Innistrad's moon]] she found that she could control the [[transform]]ation, in both directions, with relative ease. Upon her return to Avabruck years later, she found that her parents had been killed in a fire at her father's forge.\n\nAbove all else, Arlinn was desperate to ensure the survival of her kind. She had come to think of herself as part of the pack.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/under-silver-moon-2016-03-02|Under the Silver Moon|[[Kimberly J. Kreines]]|March 2, 2016}}</ref> And in a world where Avacyn either had [[cursemute]]d or killed hundreds of werewolves, and where the [[angel]]'s church had launched a new inquisition more terrifying than anything they've done before, Arlinn feared that the lycanthropes of Innistrad could meet a very real and permanent end very soon.[[File:Arlinn, Voice of the Pack.jpg|left|thumb|272x272px|Arlinn, Voice of the Pack]]\n===Fighting evil===\nAfter the death of Avacyn she reunited with the mages and [[cathars]] of Goldnight to fight evil together.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/archmage-goldnight-2016-06-08|The Archmage of Goldnight|[[Kimberly J. Kreines]]|June 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\nLater, she was seen helping Thalia and her cathars during the Battle of Thraben against Emrakul's hordes.\n\n===War of the Spark===\nArlinn was lured to [[Ravnica]] by the [[Interplanar Beacon]], and immediately became trapped there due to [[Bolas]]'s use of the [[Immortal Sun]]. Alongside many other planeswalkers and Ravnicans, she [[War of the Spark (event)|fought]] against the [[Eternal]]s of Bolas' [[Dreadhorde]].<ref name=\"Weisman Ravnica novel\">[[Greg Weisman]] (April 2019). \"''[[War of the Spark: Ravnica]]''\".

She was one of the few planeswalkers who chose to remain on Ravnica after Chandra disabled the Immortal Sun, helping the Gatewatch in their fight against Bolas. \n\n===Midnight Hunt===\n[[File:Secrets of the Key.jpg|thumb|282x282px|Arlinn asks [[Teferi]] for help in investigating the [[Moonsilver Key]].]]\nDue to the presence of [[Emrakul]] (sealed) in the [[Moon of Innistrad]], the [[plane]] has been undergoing changes in its cycle of night and day.

Upon seeing the \"army\" gathered by Tovolar and listening to his proposal, she refuses and tries to attack him, but the [[Wolf|wolves]] of her pack come between her and Tovolar. Arlinn says goodbye to her wolves, who are now with Tovolar's pack, returns to [[Katilda]] and agrees to help the [[warlock]] find the the [[Moonsilver Key]]. Arlinn goes to [[Ravnica]] to ask [[The Gatewatch]] for help in finding the Moonsilver Key. She finds them and explains Innistrad's situation to [[Teferi]], [[Kaya]], and [[Chandra Nalaar|Chandra]]. The three [[Planeswalker (lore)|planeswalkers]] agree to help Arlinn and head to Innistrad. Together with the cathar [[Adeline]] they decide to go to [[Thraben]] to investigate.<ref name=\"The Wolf\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/episode-2-motives-wolf-2021-09-08|Episode 2: The Motives of the Wolf|[[K.

In Thraben, Kaya finds an old book showing that the Key was given to an ancestor of the ''Betzold'' family by a [[warlock]]. Arlinn and Adeline knew a bishop named [[Worrin Betzold]] and belongs to this family. They end up finding him among the [[zombie]] army that [[Liliana Vess]] dropped in the midst of the ruins of Thraben (after the sealing of [[Emrakul]]). [[Cleric|Bishop]] Worrin Betzold became a zombie during the events of The Travails and now \"preaches prayers\" in the ruins of a church. The party enters Thraben pushing their way through the undead until they reach Worrin. Even dead, Worrin seems to recognize his old friend Arlinn, who interrogates him asking about the Key, but she can only get the name ''Dennick''. In an act of mercy she kills her friend so he can rest in peace. After that, the group heads to [[Gavony]], the birthplace of the Betzold family. There they get the information that the bishop's son, [[Dennick Betzold]], is in the family mansion, but that the place is haunted. Arriving at the mansion Kaya enters alone and murders the ghosts that haunt the place, so that her companions can enter the mansion. After conversing with the [[spirit]] of the late Dennick, they discover that the Key was given by the boy's great-grandfather to a [[vampire]], [[Sorin Markov]], as a way to protect the Key. Now the group head to Markov Manor and question Sorin about the whereabouts of the Key. Arlinn inquires that the [[human]]s need protection as darkness grows once more over Innistrad, but Sorin isn't worried about this issue. Upon mentioning [[Avacyn]], Sorin grows enraged and attacks Arlinn, who in her werewolf form manages to stop the attack with little damage to her. Again she mentions Avacyn and is attacked again, but this time [[Sigarda]] appears and stops the attack. The [[angel]] appears in answer to a prayer made by Arlinn before the group enters the Manor. Sigarda tells Arlinn and her group to look for the Key in Sorin's quarters as she confronts the vampire, giving the group time to go to the Key. In Sorin's quarters they find the Key over a statue of Avacyn, beheaded by Sorin, beneath a painting of Sorin with his grandfather [[Edgar Markov]]. Arlinn takes the Key.<ref name=\"Betzold\"/>[[File:Defend the Celestus.jpg|thumb|257x257px|Arlinn helps defend the [[Celestus]] from [[Tovolar|Tovolar's]] attack.|alt=|left]]After Arlinn and her party returned to the [[Celestus]] with the Key, Tovolar and his army launched an attack on the [[Harvesttide festival]]. Protection spells briefly prevented the werewolves from entering the Celestus. Meanwhile Arlinn told Kaya to take the key to Katilda and her witches. After the magical protections fell, Teferi cast a spell to delay the sunset, which also stopped the werewolves' transformations into their wolf forms. Cathars, witches and planeswalkers fought the werewolves to protect the [[human]]s. Arlinn confronted Tovolar by hitting him several times with weapons and her hands. Tovolar called Arlinn's [[Wolf|wolves]], which caused her to get distracted and knocked down. Tovolar told her he wasn't going to kill her. When Teferi's spell could no longer delay the sunset, the werewolves completed their transformation, including Arlinn.<ref name=\"Harvestide\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/episode-4-harvesttide-2021-09-22|Episode 4: Harvestide|[[K. Arsenault Rivera]]|September 22, 2021}}</ref>\n\nArlinn and Tovolar fought and both got severe wounds. Arlinn's wolf pack join Tovolar, except for [[Patience]] who stayed apart. During the fight, the alpha kept seducing the planeswalker into abandoning the humans and joining the pack. Arlinn feigned surrender, but then overpowered the unsuspecting Tovolar with a deathgrip in his chest. Crushed by her final betrayal, Tovolar surrendered and retreat with the rest of the pack. The survivors of the Harvesttide Massacre stayed behind. After the fight against Tovolar, Chandra and Adeline led Arlinn to the center of Celestus. There, the witches were performing the ritual and ask Arlinn to complete it with them. Just as Katilda was about to complete the ritual, [[Olivia Voldaren]] appeared and caught the witch in the air. Olivia  threatened to kill Katilda if Arlinn did not deliver the Key that Katilda dropped. The other witches say that only Katilda can complete the ritual. Deciding quickly, Arlinn threw the Key to the vampire, and Olivia hurled Katilda's body to the ground. To prevent Katilda from getting hurt, Arlinn threw herself in front of the witch, breaking her fall and watched Olivia leave with the Key. Thus, the [[Eternal Night]] began.<ref name=\"Night Closes\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/episode-5-night-closes-round-2021-09-29|Episode 5: Night Closes 'Round|[[K.

That is until Arlinn decided to return to Markov Manor and ask [[Sorin Markov]] for help. In the crypt of the Manor, the group encountered Sorin who says that [[Olivia Voldaren]] \"stole\" his [[Edgar Markov|grandfather]].<ref name=\"Tithes and Invitations\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/episode-1-tithes-and-invitations-2021-10-28|Episode 1: Tithes and Invitations|[[K.

Confronting Olivia Voldaren for the Key, she found herself outmatched by the vampire's bladework and suffered multiple deep injuries. Goaded by Olivia, she transformed into her wolf form and managed to overpower the Olivia's sword, but was consumed by instinctual rage. Distracted in shredding vampiric portraits, she was impaled from behind by Olivia's hand.<ref name=\"Crashers\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/episode-4-wedding-crashers-2021-11-17|Episode 4: The Wedding Crashers|[[K.

As if called to return, she awoke to find that [[Tovolar]] and her packmates had arrived to help. Although she made clear to Tovolar that nothing had changed between them, Arlinn accepted his help to track down Olivia. They found her talking with Edgar Markov who was pleading with her to end their plans. Tovolar lashed out at Edgar but was restrained by Arlinn, and Olivia was given an opportunity to make things right. Olivia dropped the [[Moonsilver Key]] and left with Edgar through one of the broken windows, barely escaping from the jaws of Tovolar. With Teferi’s assistance, Arlinn and [[the Gatewatch]] hastened their return to the [[Celestus]] to complete the ritual. Along the way, Arlinn reluctantly talked with [[Katilda]] about Tovolar and understood that a reckoning would one day come. After the balance between night and day was restored, Arlinn followed up with her friends to say goodbye. Before Teferi’s departure, he urged Arlinn to be on guard against the return of an old enemy, the [[Phyrexian]]s. As the Kessig woods called to her, Arlinn was once again happy in the company of her pack.<ref name=\"Death\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/episode-5-till-death-do-us-part-2021-11-24|Episode 5: Till Death Do Us Part|[[K.

Tracing these powerful ripples to their source, Arzakon had been stunned by the potential power inherent in Shandalar. The planeswalker’s strong desire for control of Shandalar’s rich magical energies urged it into an immediate attempt to penetrate the [[Great Barrier]]. Ever diligent, [[the Guardian]] lent strength to the barrier and easily repelled Arzakon's physical intrusion.\n\nArzakon later started [[Arzakon's War]] by convincing the five Guild Lords of Shandalar to turn on the Guardian and seek powerful magical artifacts to cast the ''Spell of Dominion''. The Guild Lords believed the spell would give them control over Shandalar, but in truth, the magic would seek out and destroy [[Chain Veil]], the artifact containing [[Lim-Dûl]]'s soul, powering the [[Great Barrier]]. Arzakon's plan was thwarted by one of the plane's spellcasters, and he was banished from the plane for good.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Arzakon was the villain of the [[Magic: The Gathering (MicroProse)|MicroProse computer game]].\n\n==Planes visited==\n*[[Shandalar]] (attempted)\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nArzakon fullbody.jpg|Arzakon's full body\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Planeswalker|characters}}\n{{Unknown Plane|characters}}\n[[Category:Unknown plane characters]]",

She is the loyal lieutenant of the [[artificer]] [[Tezzeret]], working for the [[Infinite Consortium]]. Being a [[pyromancer]], she specializes in fire [[elemental]]s though she seems to have learned some of the art of artifice from Tezzeret.\n\n==History==\n===Agents of Artifice===\nAfter [[Jace Beleren]] is scouted by the Consortium, Baltrice takes an instant and intense dislike to the mind mage and acts irrational and hot-headed. She briefly showed her good side when she let Jace escape in return for having saved her life on [[Kamigawa]], however, whatever good nature she had was proven a fluke when she repeatedly tortured Jace while he was imprisoned in Tezzeret's sanctum. When Jace escaped, she was defeated by [[Liliana Vess]] and killed.\n\n==Test of Metal==\n''Due to continuity issues, it is unclear if ''[[Test of Metal]]'' is still considered part of the canon''\n\nBaltrice was not slain by Liliana but was found by Jace when she attempted to return to Ravnica. Jace nursed her back to health, and soon, she took her position as the right hand of the Consortium once again, working for Jace out of gratitude. She turned up in Esper along with Jace in an attempt to capture Tezzeret after he set off a trap that had alerted them to his survival.\n\nThe two planeswalkers fail to capture Tezzeret and, instead, Jace is afflicted with an [[etherium]] device which prevents him from using magic, planeswalking, or his mental powers. Tezzeret agrees to remove the device if Baltrice helps him in his search for [[Crucius]] the Mad. Baltrice is suspiciously fond of Jace despite the intense hatred displayed during Tezzeret's tenure as lord of the Consortium, causing Tezzeret to believe that Jace had used his powers to mentally alter her disposition. Baltrice assists Tezzeret in his fight when they reach the [[Esper#Notable locations|Crystal Labryinth]].\n\nIn the final meeting between Tezzeret, Baltrice, and Jace, Tezzeret offers her a [[sangrite]] necklace that he claims will make her immune to mental domination. Jace warns Baltrice not to put the necklace on, that it is a trick by Tezzeret. Baltrice becomes suspicious that Jace has done exactly as Tezzeret suspected of him. Jace claims that after the fight with Vess, Baltrice’s mind was so haunted it was driving her insane and he only did enough to relieve her of the painful memories. Unsure who is telling the truth, Baltrice leaves Jace and Tezzeret without putting on the necklace.\n\n==Trivia==\n*[[Ari Marmell]] intended for Baltrice to have died during the finale of ''[[Agents of Artifice]]''. He was surprised when he learned she had survived.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20130123183305/http://community.wizards.com/go/thread/view/75842/25737625/Planeswalker_Scoresheet_RISK_OF_SPOILERS&post_num=60#472339545 Wizards.com (archived)]</ref> With much of ''Test of Metal'''s canon having been ignored or changed, Baltrice's actual final fate is left questionable as well.\n\n==Story appearances==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|-\n!Title!!Author!!Publishing date!!Set!!Setting (plane)!!Featuring\n|-\n| ''[[Agents of Artifice]]'' || [[Ari Marmell]] || January 2009 || [[Magic 2010]] || [[Grixis]], [[Kamigawa]], [[Ravnica]] || [[Jace Beleren]], [[Tezzeret]], [[Liliana Vess]], [[Nicol Bolas]], Baltrice, [[List_of_secondary_characters/Ravnica|Gemreth]], [[List_of_secondary_characters/Ravnica|Ireena]], [[Kallist Rhoka]], [[List_of_secondary_characters/Kamigawa|Kaori]], [[List_of_secondary_characters/Ravnica|Paldor]], [[List_of_secondary_characters/Ravnica|Sevrien]], [[List_of_secondary_characters/Ravnica|Xalmarias]]\n|-\n| ''[[Test of Metal]]'' || [[Matthew Stover]] || October 2010 || [[Magic 2010]] || [[Esper]], [[Ravnica]], [[Jund]], [[New Phyrexia|Mirrodin]] || [[Tezzeret]], [[Jace Beleren]], [[Nicol Bolas]], [[Crucius]], Baltrice, [[List_of_secondary_characters/Alara|Jest]], [[Sharuum]], [[Silas Renn]], [[Kemuel]], [[Liliana Vess]]\n|}\n\n==Planeswalkers met==\n*[[Jace Beleren]]\n*[[Liliana Vess]]\n*[[Tezzeret]]\n\n==Planes visited==\n*[[Aranzhur]]\n*[[Ilcae]]\n*[[Kamigawa]]\n*[[Obsidias]]\n*[[Ravnica]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Unknown Plane|characters}}\n{{Planeswalker|characters}}\n[[Category:Planeswalker Saga]]\n[[Category:Humans]]\n[[Category:Wizards]]",

His armor is white and gold colored with [[lazotep]] accents; the woven breastplate has an abstraction of Oketra's face across the chest, and he wears a heavy white cape. An empty bandolier meant to hold his cartouches hangs from his belt. The base of his spear is one of Oketra's arrows {{-}} specifically the one he retrieved in the Trial of Solidarity {{-}} fitted with a curved blade. He's a master of group tactics and strategy. When he uses his magic, he surrounds himself and his allies with a golden aura of sand that allows him to absorb the injuries of his allies and enhances the abilities of anyone within it.\n\nBasri believes in fighting for the people around him {{-}} and has the perfect powers to do so. <ref name=\"Lore Core 21\">{{DailyRef|feature/lore-core-set-2021-cards-2020-06-12|The Lore of Core Set 2021 on the Cards|[[Wizards of the Coast]]|June 2020}}</ref> He is considered kind, hopelessly optimistic, eager to fight, and confident in his ability to protect everyone.<ref name=\"Restoration\"/> Thanks to his power and natural charisma, Basri always has someone to fight alongside him.<ref name=\"Lore Core 21\">{{DailyRef|feature/lore-core-set-2021-cards-2020-06-12|The Lore of Core Set 2021 on the Cards|[[Wizards of the Coast]]|June 2020}}</ref> Basri Ket was centered in [[white]] [[mana]].\n\nHis magic appears as a swirling golden aura of sand.<ref>{{DailyRef|feature/creating-basri-ket-2020-06-08|Creating Basri Ket|Liz Leo|June 8, 2020}}</ref> \n\n==History==\nFrom an early age, Basri Ket idolized Oketra {{-}} Amonkhet's [[god]] of Solidarity {{-}} and tried to follow her teachings to the letter. Basri wanted nothing more than to prove himself to her by completing the Trial of Solidarity, and not long before the [[Hour of Devastation]], he got his chance. Basri used his power over sand during the trial to shield his crop.<ref name=\"Visual Guide\">[[Jay Annelli]] (2022). ''[[Magic: The Gathering - The Visual Guide]]'', [[Wikipedia:DK (publisher)|DK]]. ISBN-13 978-0744061055.</ref> Thanks to his leadership, his [[crop]] survived the ordeal with no casualties, and Basri himself claimed Oketra's arrow to finish the Trial. In a moment of pure elation, Basri's latent [[Planeswalker's spark]] [[igniting|ignited]] and he found himself on another [[plane]]. Believing this to be a calling from the gods, Basri spread Oketra's teachings across the [[Multiverse]] and lived by her example. When he finally learned the truth of [[Planeswalker (lore)|what he was]], he was eager to return home, but when he returned to Amonkhet, it was a smoking ruin. Oketra was dead, and everything he had believed turned out to be an elaborate lie.\n\nWith nothing to hold onto, Basri experienced a crisis of faith. Refusing to give in to despair, Basri saw his people struggling and hurting and understood that he still had a job.<ref name=\"Visual Guide\"/> He rounded up the injured and weary, encouraged them with what he knew, and realized that Oketra's teachings were still true. Truth, respect, and solidarity from her teachings lived on in her people and through him. Driven by his faith, he used his powers to bolster his comrades on the front lines and to become a force for good in the [[Multiverse]].\n\nNot much later, he lost his planeswalking abilities in the [[Desparkening]].<ref name=\"DFT Guide 2\">{{DailyRef|feature/planeswalkers-guide-to-aetherdrift-part-2|Planeswalker's Guide to Aetherdrift, Part 2|[[Miguel Lopez]]|December 11, 2024}}</ref>\n\n===Rebuilding Naktamun===\nIn the wake of the [[Hour of Devastation]] and [[New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse]], Basri decided that Naktamun needed to be united under a strong leader.<ref name=\"Restoration\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/aetherdrift-hour-of-restoration|Hour of Restoration|[[Hadeer Elsbai]]|January 13, 2025}}</ref> He believed that [[Temmet]], as the chosen of Oketra may know a way to bring the god back. He sought out his two remaining crop-mates, [[Mahitab]] and [[Niharet]], who were also the two remaining members of the crew that had entombed Temmet after his death as an Eternal, to help him find the location of the tomb. He also brought along two teenage embalmers, [[Marunaten]] and [[Merinaten]], to revive the vizier when they found him. They set off across the desert, surviving an attack from a [[Wurm|sandwurm]], and reached the tomb. When they arrived, they were confronted by an ancient pharaoh of the [[Chitin Court]], [[Munhatep]], and betrayed by Niharet, who was also aligned with the old gods. However, they were saved by the arrival of [[Ketramose]], a new god summoned by Basri's faith in Oketra. He destroyed the Chitin Court warriors and bore Temmet's body back to Naktamun.\n\nBasri worked to restore Amonkhet and unite its people, leading expeditions into the [[Broken Lands]] and parlaying with undead [[monarchs]] of the past in [[the Tombs Before Time]].<ref name=\"DFT Legends\"/> On one of these expeditions, Basri discovered [[Zahur]]'s tomb and performed the rites to awaken him.\n\n===Ghirapur Grand Prix===\nAfter the rise of Ketramose and another new god, [[Sab-Sunen]], Amonkhet rose anew through the collective effort of the living and the dead. The Amonkheti knew toil, so in the new future they were building, they made a conscious effort to make room for sport, leisure, and play as they raised heroes who didn't swing swords in battle alongside those who did. In this spirit, Basri led the Amonkheti delegation in the second [[Ghirapur Grand Prix]] alongside the undead Leonin [[Zahur]] and a crew of living and undead charioteers.<ref name=\"DFT Guide 1\">{{DailyRef|feature/planeswalkers-guide-to-aetherdrift-part-1|Planeswalker's Guide to Aetherdrift, Part 1|[[Miguel Lopez]]|December 10, 2024}}</ref> With his participation, Basri hopes to usher in a glorious future for his home.<ref name=\"DFT Legends\"/> His team rode to win glory and bring acclaim to [[Naktamun]], [[Hazoret]], the new gods, and the people of Amonkhet who still struggle to build a new plane of their own from the ruin of history.

Her brother was eventually killed in a war. Chandra began to practice and play with her newfound fire abilities to pass the time and found that her fire talent came to her naturally. However, on Kaladesh, fire magic was strictly banned, and her parents pursued many ends in an attempt to \"cure\" their daughter of her powers. Knowing that the [[Consulate]] would arrest Chandra and her family for using fire magic, they left [[Ghirapur]] when she was eleven and went to another town that was smaller than their home to avoid attention. In an attempt to scare off her parents, she set off a huge blast of fire that caught several of the village huts on fire, before running away to the mountains. In her absence, the police of a temple on her plane rounded up the village, believing the people of the village to be a group of fire-magic-practicing rebels, as they did not believe that one person could cause such destruction. They placed the villagers into the burning huts where they were to be burned to death. Chandra returned in time to see her family burned, her mother crying for her daughters to be released, and fought against the soldiers until the entire village had burned to death, at which point she surrendered. She was forced onto her knees, her head held back, and a blade swung to her throat, her punishment immediate execution.\n\nThis traumatic moment ignited her planeswalker spark, sending her to [[Regatha]].\n\n====Revised Origin====\nHowever, the story Chandra told Gideon was not the entire truth.<ref name=\"Burn\"/> In truth, she was an only child and her parents were inventors who secretly trafficked a controlled substance, the mystical [[Aether]], to those who needed it. The fire in the village wasn't lit by Chandra but by the soldiers of the Consuls, who were persecuting her. She wasn't punished at the village, but taken to the City of Ghirapur, to be executed in an arena. The blade-bearer turned out to be [[Baral]], an officer who secretly had (anti-fire) magic of his own.<ref name=\"Fire Logic\">{{DailyRef|feature/chandras-origin-fire-logic-2015-06-10|Chandra’s Origin: Fire Logic|[[Doug Beyer]]| June 10, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n===Fuel for the Fire===\nSometime after the events in her past, Chandra journeyed to [[Aretopolis]] on the [[plane]] of [[Kephalai]]. There, Chandra stole a scroll known as the [[Dragon Scroll]] from the [[Sanctum of Stars]]. She was pursued by a Watch Commander, his men, and a pair of [[gargoyle]]s. They attempted to execute her but she managed to get away using a large fire spell. Since her body was not found, they considered the matter closed, but later investigations re-opened it.\n\nThe magistrate turned to the [[Infinite Consortium]] to retrieve the scroll, and [[Jace Beleren]] was assigned to track the thief, and erase the memories of anyone who had read it. He managed to find Chandra on [[Regatha]] where she was studying at [[Keral Keep]]. Jace confronted her and a fight broke out. Jace gained the upper hand and left after completing his mission. However, Chandra had given the scroll to the scribes in the monastery who were making copies of it before Jace arrived.\n\n''The battle between Chandra and Jace is also covered in the first chapter of The Purifying Fire''.\n\n===The Purifying Fire===\n[[File:Chandra, Acolyte of Flame.png|thumb|225x225px|Young Chandra training at Keral Keep monastery, plane of Regatha]]\nChandra, right after her first planeswalk, has come to live on a plane named Regatha, where she has been studying at the Keral Keep monastery in an attempt to learn better self-control and mastery of her powers. The monastery was founded ages ago around the beliefs of another fire-wielding planeswalker, [[Jaya Ballard]]. Her quotes and teachings are the core of the Keep's beliefs, championing personal freedom and individual choice over all other things, as long as one was not infringing on another's rights.\n\n[[File:The Purifying Fire gideon and Chandra.jpg|thumb|Gideon and Chandra vs. the Order|224x224px|alt=|left]]Chandra became entangled in the politics of Regatha when the [[Order of Heliud]] begins a series of events put into place that had begun to enforce its rule over the lands of Regatha, starting with the plains, then moving to the forests, and ideally to the mountains where Keral Keep rests. The Order declared that fire magic was to be punished by death in the cities, and creature summoning, traditionally a way to resolve disputes in the Western Woods, was illegal as well. With that in mind, the allies of Keral Keep in the woods sought to consult the monastery.\n\nAfter attempting to chase away a specter that served the Order, she set fire to a large portion of the forest and angered a tribe of [[ouphe]]s who put a price on Chandra's head. The leader of the Order, Walbert, used this event, and an attack on his soldiers, as an opportunity to order Chandra's capture. Mother Luti, head of the Keral Keep mages, decided that because of the attention drawn to her, it would be a good time for Chandra to \"disappear\" for a while, and sent her on a quest to retrieve the scroll that Jace had retaken, stating that the true meaning of its words might not be in the words, but in some sort of physical attribute of the scroll itself. Heeding Mother Luti's request, Chandra once more 'walked to Kephalai.\n\nHer attempt to retake the scroll failed and her attack on a group of soldiers caused the entire Sanctum of Stars, a museum of artifacts and rarities of great power and value, to be destroyed, killing all those inside. During her flight, she encountered a man named [[Gideon Jura|Gideon]], who seemed at first to want to help her but turned her over to the soldiers of Kephalai. After her captors tried to torture the location of the scroll, which she had lost during her flight, she managed to escape from the dungeons of Kelaphai, blindly 'walking to a plane ruled by a vampire and shrouded in eternal night. Much to her surprise, none other than Gideon arrived shortly after her. Eventually enlisting the help of Gideon himself, she sought to find a way off of [[Diraden]], whose only source of mana was black. During this time, Gideon reveals that the plane of origin of the scroll is none other than the mysterious plane of [[Zendikar]], where he claims that mana and magic act in powerful, but erratic ways. Unfortunately for the pair, the inhabitants, though malnourished and mistreated, had grown treacherous after years of exposure to the mana, and they were both captured by the ruler himself, [[List of secondary characters#Diraden|Prince Velrav]]. Chandra awoke in the Prince's private chambers, and she was shown the torture Gideon was undergoing. Eventually, she concocted a plan of escape with Gideon that culminated in the death of Velrav, freeing the plane from its eternal night and restoring the flow of mana. Together, they returned to Regatha.\n\nHer return was not met with good news, though, as the plane had fallen further under the rule of the Order. Gideon revealed that he was an agent for the Order, which was a multiplanar organization, promising to bring \"peace, order, and law\" to the multiverse. After leaving him and getting to Keral Keep with the aid of allies from the forest, the Keep was laid under siege with the condition that she had to be surrendered to them, which not a single one of the free-thinking fire mages was willing to do. The entirety of the Keep valued the idea of individual freedom to the point that they would not dare infringe on Chandra's even if it meant their deaths. She eventually decided to turn herself over, expecting to encounter an execution.\n[[File:Chandra's Fury.jpg|left|thumb|228x228px|Chandra's Fury]]\nWhat awaited her was far, far worse. Planning to use the Purifying Fire, an ancient artifact that \"cleanses\" a person's soul of their sins and imperfections, Walbert planned to strip Chandra of her fire magic, leaving her powerless, as an example to any who would dare stand against the Order. To Chandra, this fate was worse than death, and she asked Gideon to kill her rather than have her \"humiliated and put on display.\" Before she was brought to the Fire, Gideon spoke with her, and claimed that she may be able to keep her power if the Fire accepted her, if she entered it with a \"clean soul.\" She told him of her history and how her actions led to the death of her family in a painful fire and the destruction of her entire village, something she had been running from and what had been causing her nightmares ever since.\n\nShe declared that she didn't know \"what clean is, but I do feel better\" after her confession. Walbert, on the way to the Fire, explained that he had seen Chandra in his visions, that she was a cataclysm that would bring an era of lawless madness to Regatha, which was why he aimed to stop her and secure his rule, believing that when a planeswalking fire mage was stripped of her power, the rest of the Keep would fall into place.\n\nThe Fire, however, accepted her as she entered it with a clean soul, removing all the wards and shields placed around her by Walbert. She faced her past, her mistakes and victories, her successes and failures, taking them all for what they were and nothing more, no longer running. When she emerged from the Fire, she felt infused with more focus than ever, and decimated the Order's forces around her, burning Walbert and many others to death and cracking the very foundations of the cavern. She was knocked out when the chamber around the Fire collapsed.\n\nGideon woke her up, harshly chastising her for leading to the deaths of all the members of the Order, yet she felt no remorse for taking down what they believed in. She decided to leave the plane of Regatha forever and seek out the mystically powerful plane of Zendikar. Before she left, though, she told Gideon a part of her story that she had held back the night before: that the soldiers that so brutally ordered the death of her village at the slightest false provocation belonged to an order that promised to bring \"harmony, protection, and law,\" leaving him to ponder the revelation of his allegiances and what the Order he belonged to had done. She told him that should anyone proclaiming the virtues of the Order (and by extension white magic) cross her path, she would treat them as her enemies without remorse. With that, she left, seeking Zendikar.<ref name=TPF> ''[[The Purifying Fire]]''</ref>\n\n===Journey to the Eye===\n[[File:Chandra ghostfire.jpg|left|thumb|252x252px|Chandra uses ghostfire in the Eye of Ugin]]\nChandra arrived on Zendikar, roughly three years after her quest began, and sought out a guide to the region of Akoum in the area of Affa Town. Her exact goal was to seek the assistance of the ruin sage [[Anowon]], hoping that he could shed some light on finding the [[Eye of Ugin]].<ref>[[Jenna Helland]] (2009), \"''[[Journey to the Eye]]''\", [[Wizards of the Coast]]</ref> After repeated failures on the part of her guides, and more than a few gold coins, she finally managed to track down the League of Anowon's current campsite high in the mountains. She confronted Anowon there and after a brief and tense exchange, Anowon agreed to lead her.\n\nUnfortunately, Anowon proved to be a backstabbing traitor. He attempted to kill her in her sleep, but she rebuffed his initial assault. Anowon ranted at Chandra and claimed that she had no right to the scroll he wanted and continued his attack as her magic gave out. Luckily for Chandra, [[Sarkhan Vol]] ambushed Anowon, rendering him unconscious with a swift strike to the head.\n\n===Awakenings===\nThough Sarkhan had saved Chandra, he threatened her for intruding into the Eye of Ugin.<ref name=\"Awakenings\">[[Doug Beyer]] (2010), \"''[[Awakenings]]''\", [[Wizards of the Coast]]</ref> Chandra then attempted to cast a spell, which backfired but was sufficient to impress Sarkhan. He led her further into the Eye and began to explain to her the nature of what she was searching for. It was not what she was expecting, and as she attempted to leave Sarkhan wheeled upon her, changing fully into a dragon. Left without her usual magic, she received assistance from the unexpected source of Jace Beleren. With his encouragement, she cast a fire spell that could not be seen. It was enough to down Sarkhan, and as a side effect, Jace as well.\n\nShe momentarily considered killing Jace simply because he continued to show up, but she instead woke him up. They had a brief exchange in which Jace questioned the motives of the mysterious individual who had told Chandra of the scroll to begin with. She ignored him and walked away, planning to exact some measure of vengeance on the person who had gotten her involved with the scroll.\n\n===Tracking Ramaz===\n{{Ambiguous}}\nAfter leaving Jace behind, Chandra bounced from plane to plane searching for clues as to who [[Ramaz]] was. He was the one who had manipulated her into stealing the [[Dragon Scroll]] and she intended to seek her vengeance. Knowing just enough about her target, she tracked his progress across multiple planes, often retreading old grounds that she had visited in the past. Her final goal was finally met on the plane of [[Kaldheim (plane)|Kaldheim]] where she confronted the insane [[shaman]]. After a skirmish, he escaped, revealing that he had only been a [[minion]] in a yet greater scheme, subservient to the mysterious [[Nicol Bolas|dragon]] whose voice he followed.\n\n===Abbot of Keral Keep===\nChandra returned to [[Regatha]] and studied pyromancy at [[Keral Keep]] for a considerable time. After her mentor [[Serenok]] died, she was elected to become the new abbot. However, the ceremony was interrupted by Jace Beleren and Gideon Jura. Both men attempted to convince her to follow them to help in the fight on Zendikar, but a frustrated Chandra who was angry at continuously being compared to Jaya Ballard chose to stay. She knew that Jaya would have helped them but she was sick and tired of being compared to her. After rejecting Jace and Gideon, who were both disappointed with her choice, they told her to come to Sea Gate on Zendikar if she changed her mind.

Chandra offered to burn the Titans instead and after preventing Kiora from attacking Nissa, Jace agreed. The pyromancer then connected with the animist, allowing her to channel her pyromantic magic through Zendikar's Ley Lines directly into the Titans.

Liliana used the opportunity to invite Chandra to take revenge on Baral. During their continued search, they became witnesses of unrest where aether had been drawn from Ghirapur's systems. The blackout was caused by a rogue artificer referred to as \"Renegade Prime\" by a man with silver-grey locks and a metallic arm by the name of \"''[[Tezzeret]]''\", referred to as the Head Judge.

Chandra and Nissa were found by an old friend of the Nalaars, the lifecrafter [[Oviya Pashiri]].

Baral lured the group into an airtight, enchanted <c>Deadlock Trap</c>, intending to turn Chandra's pyromancy against them by using up the air faster while filling the trap with poisonous gas. Not even the combined power of the two planeswalkers managed to crack the prison. Chandra then explained what she saw in the Gatewatch - a family that would remain with her regardless of the plane she was on.

Public announcements that told of the execution of Renegade Prime during the grand finale of the Inventors' Fair caused the group to mix with the crowd. Chandra watched, barely restrained by Jace, as her mother and the Head Judge battled each other. When finally confronting him, Tezzeret mocked Chandra, reminding her that this was the same arena where she had been once sentenced to death. When her planeswalker allies revealed themselves and fought against his constructs, the Head Judge quickly fled the scene. Discovering that their presence had been used as a distraction to confiscate the inventions displayed at the Fair and to take the inventors prisoner, the Gatewatch swore to uncover what Tezzeret had planned.

Chandra countered that it didn't matter and that Tezzeret and the Consulate were the same. Gideon reminded her that the purpose of the Gatewatch was not to travel from plane to plane to impose their judgment on the world's inhabitants. Otherwise, they would be no better than tyrants.

Chandra was assigned to stay on the Heart of Kiran and protect it against the Consulate attacks together with Saheeli and Gideon. However, Dovin Baan had managed to pierce their defenses and infiltrate their freight room to sabotage the thopter. Chandra attacked him but only managed to damage the ''Heart of Kiran'' further. As Baan planeswalked away, the remaining planeswalkers had to improvise. Chandra volunteered to enter the thopter and use her fire magic as a detonator instead.

At Jace's recommendation, they decided to split up into teams to focus on specific tasks. Chandra, Saheeli, [[Lavinia]], and [[Lazav]] were tasked with shutting off the [[Immortal Sun]]. Lazav disguised himself as Chandra in the fight against [[Dovin Baan]], using illusions and an [[Izzet League]] flamethrower to replicate the effects of her pyromancy. This deception allowed the real Chandra to sneak into Baan's facility and disable the Immortal Sun, allowing many planeswalkers to leave Ravnica. Lazav subsequently defeated Baan, blinding him with throwing stars and causing him to planeswalk away.\n\nLater, as part of Gideon's plan to kill Nicol Bolas, she reactivated the Immortal Sun to prevent Bolas from planeswalking away.<ref name=\"Ashes\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/war-spark-ravnica-ashes-2019-06-12|War of the Spark: Ravnica – Ashes|[[Greg Weisman]]|June 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhen Gideon sacrificed his life to save Liliana, Chandra misunderstood what had happened, believing Liliana had killed him.

[[IDW Publishing]].</ref> She essentially became a one-woman Gatewatch and visited many planes to help the innocent, but continually slid down a self-destructive path with ever-increasing desperation. This was reinforced by emphatic attacks from the planeswalker [[Tibalt]], who fed on her agony. After battling the half-devil planeswalker and losing to him, she planeswalked away to Zendikar.\n\nOn the ruined plane, she contemplated what had happened on Ravnica and what she needed to do to regain control of herself. In the end, she decided she needed to travel to where it began - back to Amonkhet and the site of the Gatewatch's defeat at the hands of Nicol Bolas. After battling a group of Eternals, she found herself at the Necropolis before an idol of the Elder Dragon. There, she unleashed her rage, obliterating the statue; symbolically defeating the foe that had haunted her. \n\nDone with her quest; she planeswalked to Alara, to speak to Ajani whom she knew shared a similar experience in the past. Together, the two decided to head back to Kaladesh, so Chandra could apologize to her mother. However, once there, the duo found Tibalt awaiting them, with Consul Nalaar bound and tortured beside him. As Tibalt was distracted by their entrance, Pia could escape from his clutches. Tibalt immediately attacked Chandra but quickly noted her renewed self-confidence. Realizing that he couldn't compete with both Chandra and Ajani on their home turf, he fled to Innistrad. Chandra and Ajani followed in pursuit.\n\nOn his homeplane, Tibalt was aided by a horde of [[devil]]s and could overwhelm his opponents. Gloating, he revealed that on [[Ravnica]] he had felt Chandra's pain screaming through the [[aether]]. He had followed her to [[Regatha]] to find out if he could hurt her even more, admitting that he thrived on physical torment, psychic misery, and emotional anguish. Chandra realized that Tibalt's aim was for her to lose herself all along and that he might be eviler than [[Bolas]] for that. Her self-confidence asserted itself, and she now knew that her guilt and sadness wouldn't go away but that it didn't have to mean that she had to be weakened by it. Done feeding Tibalt, she knocked him out and delivered him to the local authorities to deal with. She had finally found peace with herself.\n\n===Midnight Hunt===\n[[Arlinn Kord]] went to [[Ravnica]] to ask [[The Gatewatch]] for help in finding the [[Moonsilver Key]].

She found a clue in a book about the whereabouts of the [[Moonsilver Key]]. The Key should be in the possession of the Betzold family. Arlinn and Adeline knew a [[Cleric|bishop]] of the [[Church of Avacyn]] with that last name. They located bishop [[Worrin Betzold]] amid the ruins of a church. The group made their way through the zombies until they reached the bishop. Chandra fended off and incinerated several zombies with her flames. Upon reaching the church, Chandra raised a wall of flame to protect the perimeter. Arlinn interrogated the zombie bishop and was given a name, ''Dennick''. The group moved to [[Gavony]], where the family had a mansion. In the ruins of the mansion, they found the [[spirit]] of [[Dennick Betzold]] who told the group the location of the Key. The key had been given by an ancestor of Dennick to [[Sorin Markov]]. At Markov Manor, Teferi and Arlinn waited with Sorin for the [[vampire]] to hand over the Key so they could help restore balance to Innistrad. The vampire refuses and strikes Arlinn when she mentions [[Avacyn]]. Before his second strike, [[Sigarda]] appeared by answering a prayer made by the group before entering the Manor and stopped the attack. The [[angel]] says that the Key is in Sorin's quarters and that she will stop the vampire, giving the group a chance to get the Key.<ref name=\"Betzold\"/> \n\nThe party returned to the [[Celestus]] in possession of the Key.

[[Shattered Chains|Magic: The Gathering - ''Shattered Chains'']]. Harper Prism.</ref> \n\n==Description==\nWhen [[Greensleeves]] and [[Gull]] met Chaney, she was ancient, perhaps centuries old. Her skin was pale and almost translucent, with blue veins visible beneath. She had suffered a stroke, leaving half her face palsied and one of her arms all but useless. She also drooled a bit from the side of her mouth that was nerveless. Her hair was long, yellow-white and brittle, but by the shape of her face, both Gull and Greensleeves noted that Chaney had likely been a beauty in her youth.<ref name=\"shattered\"/>\n\nAfter her death, Chaney returned as a [[shade]] which shone with youth and beauty. She was slim, with a heart-shaped face and long hair the color of autumn leaves. She wore a simple white woolen dress, and walked barefoot, and she glowed with an inner light.<ref name=\"fsacrifice\"/>\n\n==History==\nBy her own accord, Chaney had been able to [[planeswalk]] in her youth, but hadn't done so in many years. She still possessed powerful magic though, and healed [[Greensleeves]]' broken ankle and [[Gull]]'s old knee wound. Chaney taught Greensleeves how to harness [[mana]], and about [[planeswalk]]ing. During her training, Greensleeves found out that [[time]] in Chaney's house flew differently, and what seemed to be mere days, were indeed years. When Gull and the rest of the army found her only days after she left, Greensleeves had become several years older, aging from a thin and small 17-year-old to a full-bloomed woman in her 20s. She had also become a much more skilled wizard and druid. Although she had staved off death for many years, Chaney's mortality finally caught up with her. In her dying moment, her life force was absorbed by Greensleeves.<ref name=\"shattered\"/>\n\nThree years later, Chaney returned as a [[shade]], urging Greensleeves to make the \"final sacrifice\". After Greensleeves dons the [[Stone Brain]] and finds out that its ultimate secret is buried somewhere in the ruins of the [[College of Lat-Nam]], Chaney's shade passed on to the afterlife.<ref name=\"fsacrifice\">[[Clayton Emery]] (1995). [[Final Sacrifice|Magic: The Gathering - ''Final Sacrifice'']]. Harper Prism.</ref>\n\n==On Chaney's planeswalkerhood==\nThere is no direct evidence to support Chaney's claim of planeswalkerhood, only her word. She may have exaggerated or lied about this to increase her esteem, possibly by sensing [[Greensleeves]]'s planeswalker spark. She is never seen to be planeswalking, and she also calls teleportation and planeswalking the same thing. Additionally, she dies of old age, something a planeswalker at that time should not do. However, she may have lost her planeswalker spark earlier in life and become mortal again, leading to her senescence and eventual death.

He was a young human with long, dark hair and green eyes. He stood at 6’1″ and weighed 175 lbs. His right hand and forearm were permanently dyed a deep red nearly to his elbow, as a punishment for a past theft.<ref name=\"Duels\"/> He had the innate ability of [[psychometry]], the capability to absorb knowledge from objects by touch. Throughout his many adventures, he showed remarkable intelligence and agility. Although he was thought to be a selfish thief (something he thought he should be but wasn't), Dack commonly let the benefit of others get in the way of his pursuit of wealth. He had a strong sense of self-preservation (or at least believed he should have), although his desire to aid others conflicted with it, which eventually led to his untimely demise.\n\nHe used his ability of psychometry to absorb the spells of items he touched, using their unorthodox spells to remarkable efficiency. During the [[War of the Spark (event)|War of the Spark]], he used a spell taken from a ring to incinerate undead one at a time, while at another instance, he used a magnetism spell to cause the [[Lazotep]] [[zombie]]s to become stuck together, slowing their advance, and at times, outright incapacitating them.\n\nDack Fayden was centered in both [[blue]] and [[red]] mana. As he planeswalked, he disappeared in a puff of purple smoke.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Dack.jpg|left|thumb|Dack and Mariel|267x267px]]\nDack hailed from [[Drakeston]] on [[Fiora]]. In his adolescence, Dack showed great promise in the magical arts. His psychometry gave him an enormous advantage when he joined the magical academy where he spent his youth. He rose to the top of his class and befriended his biggest rival, a boy by the name of [[List of secondary characters#Fiora|Marsh]]. They were inseparable and were possibly the best mages at the academy, but while they had talent, they were sorely lacking in wisdom. The longer they were members of the academy, the cockier they became, and their hubris would ultimately prove their undoing. \n\nAfter their exams one year, the pair went out to celebrate, taking it as an excuse to cause trouble. Unfortunately, they picked a fight with a band of ruffians, not expecting them to be adept at magic as well. The pair seemed to fight with hands, but they were so used to fighting with spells that Marsh never expected the sword that would kill him. Stunned at the loss of his friend, Dack left himself open and the group hit him with the strongest spell in their repertoire. Lying smoldering next to the body of his friend, Dack’s [[spark]] flared and he ascended.\n\nDack found his way back to Drakeston after the tragedy. With his future cut short, Dack took to stealing to make his living. After his return, he rediscovered his childhood friend [[List of secondary characters#Fiora|Mariel]], and as they grew close once again, he was smitten. He told her everything that had happened, including his trips to other worlds. He started to teach her how to be a thief, a dangerous and thrilling life, but it caused too much stress between the two and it eventually became too much for Mariel. Dack’s recklessness was more than she could bear and she left to go back to Drakeston. Dack went with her, but there wasn’t enough there for him to make his living, and so he turned to his poorly understood gift. He started to search the worlds for items he could steal and that quest took him to the world of [[Alkabah]]. He quickly found an artifact of great power that he decided to… liberate, but things went poorly when he discovered the artifact was not unguarded. The guardian [[Djinn]] beat him horribly and left him for the city guards. He was taken to prison to serve out his sentence, and part of that punishment was the torturous treatment that permanently stained his hand red, forever proclaiming him a thief. It took days, possibly weeks for Dack to finally tap into his ability and planeswalk back to Drakeston.\n\nBut instead, he arrived at the scene of a massacre.\n\nThe corpses of his friends and neighbors were strewn about, the entire town having been murdered while he was away. Nothing hurt him more than seeing Mariel’s body though. He fled, unable to bear the pain and wondering if he had been there, could he have saved anyone? He nursed his pain and swore that he would destroy whoever had done this to him.\n\nHe wandered both Fiora and the greater worlds beyond it, all the while honing his skills as a thief and making quite a living trading items from one world to another. His magical abilities grew with each theft because he stole not only the items themselves but also the various magics they contained. He eventually settled in [[Ravnica]], a home as convenient as any he could ask for. He worked his way into the vast network of spies and thieves, earning a reputation and friends amongst Ravnica’s seedy underbelly. Everything changed when he stole [[Ancient Fang|a dagger]] from the [[Cult of Rakdos]].\n\nThe dagger held memories from everyone who had used it, and to his shock, it had once been held by the planeswalker who had murdered the people of Drakeston. From the blade, after years of searching, he learned who was responsible for the deaths of everyone he had known. Her name was [[Sifa Grent]]. Sifa had given the dagger to the Cult of Rakdos for several reasons—chiefly to secure their loyalty, but more to keep it away from those who might want it on the plane from which it had originated, a world known as [[Innistrad (plane)|Innistrad]].\n\n===Innistrad===\n[[File:Dack Fayden and Sorin.jpg|left|thumb|Dack Fayden and Sorin|270x270px]]\nDack immediately dropped everything he was doing and ventured into the unknown world. He wasted no time in blundering directly into the [[vampire]]s of the world, gaining the enmity of the [[Falkenrath]] in the process. However, what he could not know was that Sifa was far closer than he expected, and his actions had tipped her to his presence on the plane.\n\nEverything was not lost, though, for in his opposition to the Falkenraths, he had gained the attention of allies: a Cathar named [[Ingrid Reichert]] and her father [[List of secondary characters/Innistrad|Hermann]]. Ingrid and Dack rode out to confront Sifa in the Falkenrath castle, but when they arrived, they found only a skeleton guard. They dispatched them easily, but to their horror, they learned that Sifa had taken the majority of them to search for Dack and destroy the town if necessary. Dack managed to intervene just as Sifa gathered the entire town—a tactic similar to the one she employed in Drakeston. Dack drove Sifa and her minions away, but he lost her before he could exact his revenge.\n\nHermann and Ingrid led the efforts to plunder Sifa’s castle and uncovered inconceivable notes in languages they did not understand. Dack began to tell them of planeswalkers and other worlds, but he realized quickly that they weren’t listening. Indeed, they weren’t moving at all. Someone had cast a stasis spell on them while he hadn’t been paying attention. The spell’s owner made his presence known soon enough. [[Sorin Markov]] had come for the Ancient Fang, the dagger Sifa had used and the one Dack had used to track her down. He traded knowledge of Sifa for the dagger and the lives of the Cathars.\n\nSorin’s information pointed Dack to the world of [[Grixis]], before the [[Conflux (event)|conflux]] of [[Alara]]. He was quickly captured by the [[demon]] [[Malfegor]], who had devious plans to try to steal Dack’s [[spark]] for himself so he could finally escape the tiny world of Grixis. It was a task he had tried before, which is what led to Sifa’s ascension. Before Malfegor could attempt his plan though, Dack escaped and used his power to learn more about Sifa, including what had triggered her spark. Unfortunately, it offered little insight into what she was up to or where she had gone. With few other options, he returned to Ravnica to find what she wanted with the Rakdos.\n\n===Return to Ravnica===\n[[File:Dack Fayden.jpg|right|thumb|Dack on Fiora|310x310px]]\nUnfortunately, when he arrived, things had already been set in motion. The Rakdos were looking for him and attacking his known associates to get to him. Amidst all this, he learned that couriers were vanishing as well, and the invitations to the rejuvenation of [[Vitu-Ghazi]] were falling into the wrong hands. Using his psychometry on one of the messages, Dack figured out Sifa’s plan. She was plotting to drain the power from all of Vitu Ghazi with the same spell she had used to consume the life from Drakeston. With his motley crew of misfits and thieves, Dack rushed to the City Tree, arriving just in time to confront her and her forces. An enormous battle was waged in the boughs of the tree and Sifa had Dack on the ropes, but just like his friend Marsh, from ages ago… she forgot to protect herself from a sword. One of Dack’s colleagues managed to stab her from behind, wounding Sifa horribly at the cost of his own life. Dack loomed over Sifa as she bled, trying to suck the life from the tree to restore her health, but Dack would not allow it and cut loose with his most powerful spell, bringing vengeance upon the death mage at last.\n\nNow Dack’s vendetta was done, but his life was left adrift.\n\n===Theros===\nFollowing rumors that the [[Boros Legion]] had acquired a weapon that might upset the balance of peace on Ravnica, Dack broke into [[Sunhome]] to take the gem from them. Unfortunately, he could not locate it before several angels located him. Rather than tipping his hand, he grabbed the first thing he could and leaped out of the window, quickly losing pursuers in the crowds below.\n\nHowever, the random relic he had grabbed (a magical gauntlet) proved to be far more than he could have expected. It spoke to him, tempting him with secrets that he could scarcely imagine. Using his gift, he was inundated with images and power of a [[God|vast and ancient being]] and a mysterious [[island]], but despite that, he was no wiser. Only two things became apparent. The gauntlet was incomplete, and its other half lay elsewhere. His travels took him to [[Theros (plane)|Theros]]. [[File:Dack Fayden and Ashiok.jpg|left|thumb|Dack Fayden and Ashiok|285x285px]] On Theros, Dack found himself surrounded by thugs, who didn't heed his words of warning. After defeating them, a thankful boy took him to his father's ship, the ''Hadross''. Fayden hired Captain Vog to take him to the island from his vision. On the island, Fayden found a cave filled with hundreds of human [[skeleton]]s and petrified men. After he found a metal arm guard, which was the other part of the magical gauntlet, he was attacked by the [[gorgon]] [[Hythonia]] and by a [[witch]] but managed to escape. \n\nSafely back on the ''Hadross'', the crew found themselves being attacked by a [[kraken]]. Fayden slipped on the completed gauntlet, felt an ancient power within him, and defeated the sea creature. \n\nBack in [[Meletis]], Fayden had [[nightmare]]s every night. He had been studying the gauntlet, but it only showed him images he couldn't translate. He met the magic user [[list of secondary characters#Theros|Atha]] who told him that he would be affected by a Sleep Curse very soon because of his magical powers. Nobody knew that [[Ashiok|Ashiok, the Nightmare Weaver]] caused the Sleep Curse, and no one knew how to cure it. Her village was decimated by this curse, and now Fayden had it too. Dack decided to seek help from others on Theros and was last seen entering a portal to Theros's [[Underworld]].<ref>{{DailyRef|feature/checking-planeswalkers-2015-2015-08-19|Checking in on the Planeswalkers (2015)|[[Mel Li]]|August 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Return to crime===\nHaving somehow escaped from the Underworld, Dack traded the gauntlet to someone who agreed to cure his curse. Disappointed that he didn't get any money out of the deal, he left Theros and continued his adventures through the Multiverse. [[Ravnica]] became his adopted home.\n\nAt some point over the next few years, he racked up an enormous debt to [[List of secondary characters/Ravnica|J'dashe]], an Orzhov pontiff who had been funding his heists. J'dashe's death didn't help since he came back as a ghost and became even harsher to his debtors than he had been in life. Desperate to pay J'dashe back, Dack spent the next few months on Innistrad trying to find valuable relics that the pontiff would be interested in.<ref name=\"Weisman Ravnica novel\">[[Greg Weisman]] (April 2019). \"''[[War of the Spark: Ravnica]]''\". Del Rey.</ref>\n\n===War of the Spark===\n[[File:Dack's fate.png|right|thumb|Dack's fate]]\nDack was lured back to Ravnica by the [[Interplanar Beacon]] and immediately became trapped there due to [[Bolas]]'s use of the [[Immortal Sun]]. He was disappointed to return to Ravnica empty-handed but soon found that he had bigger problems than J'dashe. Alongside many other planeswalkers and Ravnicans, he [[War of the Spark (event)|fought]] against the [[Eternal]]s of Bolas' [[Dreadhorde]].<ref name=\"Weisman Ravnica novel\">[[Greg Weisman]] (April 2019). \"''[[War of the Spark: Ravnica]]''\". Del Rey.</ref>\n\nDuring the invasion, the trapped planeswalkers got together with Ravnican leaders to strategize. At the meeting, Dack flirted with [[Saheeli Rai]], though he also considered stealing her gold jewelry. He also managed to touch [[Kiora]]'s bident without her noticing, hoping to copy the divine artifact's powers with his psychometric ability, but this failed, as the attempt made him look like he regretted his decision.<ref name=\"Magic Story\">{{WebRef|url=https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-story/war-spark-ravnica-rallying-reluctant-2019-05-22|title=War of the Spark: Ravnica – Rallying the Reluctant|author=Greg Weisman|date=May 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAt [[Jace]]'s recommendation, they decided to split up into teams to focus on specific tasks. [[Karn]], [[Ob Nixilis]], Dack Fayden, and [[Samut]] volunteered to go through Bolas' [[Planar Bridge]] to [[Amonkhet]] and shut the portal down from the other side. While Nixilis and Samut fought off the Eternals, Dack distracted Tezzeret, giving Karn an opening to fly one of [[Saheeli Rai|Saheeli's]] explosive micro-drones into the Bridge control mechanism in Tezzeret's chest. The portal collapsed, and the wounded Tezzeret revealed that he was glad they defeated him: he hoped they succeed at killing Bolas so he could finally be freed from his servitude to the dragon. With that, Tezzeret planeswalked away.\n\nThe planeswalkers were then visited by the god [[Hazoret]], who arrived with the rogue planeswalker [[Sarkhan Vol]]. At Sarkhan's request, Hazoret gave them her spear to aid them in their fight against Bolas. Dack considered escaping to safety (as Ob Nixilis did), but Hazoret convinced him to return to the battle on Ravnica, telling him that he was a better man than he knew. Dack had a second chance to escape when Chandra disabled the Immortal Sun, yet once again he declined the opportunity. He was one of the few planeswalkers who chose to remain on Ravnica, helping the Gatewatch in their fight against Bolas.\n\nWhen Gideon suggested reactivating the Immortal Sun to prevent Bolas from escaping, Dack gave his support for the plan.<ref name=\"Ashes\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/war-spark-ravnica-ashes-2019-06-12|War of the Spark: Ravnica – Ashes|[[Greg Weisman]]|June 12, 2019}}</ref> Ironically, this would turn out to be his undoing: in the final stage of the battle, he was surrounded by Eternals and found himself unable to escape.

He is left-handed.<ref>{{DailyRef|announcements/secret-lair-knows-its-left-its-other-left-2022-04-01|Secret Lair Knows its Left From its Other Left|[[Wizards of the Coast]]|April 1, 2022}}</ref> He wears dark-colored armor that he forged himself, along with a shield styled with a dragon and his sword: the [[Blackblade]], which he forged using magic and dark rituals. The sword was created at the request of Geyadrone Dihada as a reward for igniting Dakkon's [[planeswalker's spark]]. Dihada used the sword to steal Dakkon's shadow, forcing him to serve her. His armor covers his entire body except his hands and his face, which is always obscured by a kind of \"shadow.\" His glowing red eyes and mouth are the only visible parts of his face.\n\nDakkon has a violent personality and is short-tempered. He is a master warrior in hand-to-hand combat and an exquisite blacksmith. He has magical healing powers, increased strength, and [[exile|banish]] [[creature]]s. Dakkon had access to [[white]], [[blue]] and [[black]] [[mana]].\n\n==History==\n===[[Forging the Blackblade]]===\n[[File:Dakkon.jpg|thumb|right|Dakkon, Bearer of the Blackblade]]\nAs a mortal, Dakkon was a master [[Artificer|blacksmith]] and a [[warrior]]. One day, he was visited by the planeswalker [[Geyadrone Dihada]], who offered to make him a planeswalker if he would make her the most powerful blade in existence, the [[Blackblade]]. He agreed, and she shared with him the secret sorceries required to make the sword a \"soul-drinker\", a blade capable of stealing the energy of those it killed. Dakkon claimed to have stood at his anvil every day for ten years, cooling the blade by killing a slave with it each time he heated it. Dakkon was willing to sacrifice even his son [[Daron]] to the blade in his quest for power.<ref name=\"Planes of Multiverse\">{{WikiRef|author=[[Jay Annelli]]|date=2021|title=Magic: The Gathering - Planes of the Multiverse|publisher=Abrams ComicArts}}</ref><ref name=\"Book of Dihada\"/> Finally, the blade was completed, and Dakkon could not help but test it.\n\nDakkon waded into battle and, with each kill, felt his strength grow. So ferocious was his assault that as tales spread of his slaughter, his name became \"Dakkon Blackblade\". Dihada returned when she heard these stories and did make him a planeswalker, having sensed the [[spark]] within him when they first met, but immediately afterward, she stabbed the sword into Dakkon's shadow and absorbed his soul but not his life. Plunging the Blackblade into Dakkon's shadow, she bound his soul into the blade as his planeswalker spark [[Planeswalker (lore)/Igniting|ignited]]. Dakkon was left wandering the plane, wondering why Dihada would grant him so much power, only to make him her enemy.\n\n===The [[Blackblade-Dihada War]]===\n[[File:Dakkon and Piru.jpg|thumb|189x189px|Dakkon kills [[Piru]]|alt=|left]]\nMany years later, Dihada began a war on [[Corondor]]. A young thief from the fallen kingdom of [[Carth (location)|Carth]] fell to Dihada and was imprisoned in her dungeons. With the help of a [[monk]] in the same cell, the young man escaped. The boy (known as the [[Son of Carth]]) used the [[Amulet of Ti-Fu]] to bind himself to Dakkon, robbing Dakkon of the ability to planeswalk away. Dakkon was not so easily won over, though, and attacked Carth, intent on slaying him and ending his servitude, but the amulet protected Carth and left Dakkon with no choice but to serve. Serve he did, happily, when he learned of Carth's enemy, Dihada herself. Dihada heard of the two and sent her corrupted [[Maro-Sorcerer]], [[Sol’Kanar]], to slay the pair. Her plans did not go as she anticipated because Dakkon bested the natural spirit.\nDihada made herself known then, laughing as the combatants fought for her pleasure. She summoned the [[Elder Dragon]]s [[Piru]] and [[Chromium Rhuell]] to attack Dakkon, considering Carth below her notice. Carth managed to sneak close enough to reclaim the Blackblade. Dakkon used his power to banish Chromium immediately. Piru then fought him but was killed when Dakkon stabbed her with the Blackblade, which Carth had returned to him. This released a massive energy blast that created the [[Dueling Chasm of Golthonor]].<ref name=Dakkon/>\n\nThis was all exactly as Dihada had planned, as she absorbed the power of Piru's soul and took on her true [[demon]]ic visage. She then revealed to Carth that the monk who had set Carth on his quest was none other than Dihada herself. The entire thing had been an elaborate plot to empower her with Piru's soul, but she was abruptly cut off as Dakkon struck at her. Unfortunately, Dakkon's great power was absorbed by Dihada as it left her mark on him, a glyph that stole his planeswalker spark and ensured his servitude to her. Dihada announced he would serve for all eternity. Dakkon cursed the boy for having ever summoned him in the first place, but Carth had seen something Dakkon had missed - Dakkon's shadow had returned.<ref>{{WebRef|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20021204234803/www.acclaim.com/games/magic/index.html|title=The Story of the Battlemage Ravidel|author=WotC|date=1996}}</ref><ref name=Dakkon/>\n\n===Bound to Dihada===\nHe and the boy traveled to [[Terisiare]], where the boy started the [[Carthalion]] legacy, named after Dakkon's nickname for the boy, \"Carth the Lion\". After the boy died, Dakkon probably served as Dihada’s main warrior. Ages later, Dihada and Dakkon were present during the [[Planeswalkers' War]] of Corondor. One of the key players during this war was [[Jared Carthalion]], the last surviving member of the Carthalions at the time, but it is unknown how Dakkon interacted with him. They both survived the war, and Dakkon faded from history once again.<ref name=\"Dominian FAQ\">{{WebRef|url=https://archive.org/details/the-duelist-26/page/n27/mode/2up|title=Dominian FAQ|author=[[Pete Venters]]|date=June 1998}}</ref>\n\n===Korlash===\nAt an undisclosed point in time, an undead being named [[Korlash]] claimed the Blackblade, but it hasn't been revealed yet if he did so before or after becoming a [[zombie]].\n\n===The Blackblade reforged===\nThe Blackblade would later come into the possession of the [[Cabal]] [[minion]] [[List of secondary characters/Dominaria|Needle]], and the Cabal rewrote its origins to having been forged by the Cabal's new leader, [[Belzenlok]].<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/return-dominaria-episode-1-2018-03-21|Return to Dominaria: Episode 1|[[Martha Wells]]|March 21, 2018}}</ref> Later, the planeswalker [[Gideon Jura]] used the Blackblade to attack [[Nicol Bolas]], but the sword broke against the Elder Dragon's flesh.<ref name=\"Weisman Ravnica novel\">[[Greg Weisman]] (April 2019). \"''[[War of the Spark: Ravnica]]''\".

Guided by its voice, he inscribed demonic sigils on his forge and his skin, donned a set of magically imbued armor, and crafted the sword, which the entity now inhabits and shares its name with. Shadow Slayer needs souls to enter the material plane and becomes the dominant personality when its hunger manifests. Having already lost a part of his soul to Shadow Slayer, Dakkon is now imprisoned by his armor: should he remove it, he would turn to dust in seconds.\n\nDakkon wears a suit of draconic armor known as the Ur-Armor, which greatly empowers him but makes him dependent on its power.<ref name=\"DnD\"/> Under Shadow Slayer's instruction, Dakkon forged the soul of a female [[wyvern]] into a shield.

[[Wizards of the Coast]].</ref> \n\n==Appearance and characteristics==\nDavriel is a domineering figure with a pencil mustache, dark slicked-back hair, a black suit, a fluffy shirt, and a violet cravat. He is known as the '''Lord of the Manor''' of the small town of [[Verlasen]], but at the nearby priory he poses as '''Lord Greystone'''. In public, he wears a cloak and a mask that has been charmed to obfuscate his features. The deep black cloak has a distinctive ghostly tattered bottom — like the frayed spirit of a haunting geist. When it moves, it leaves faint smudges in the air, obscuring his exact position. With it, he is able to hide in the shadows. The golden mask is manufactured in a demonic shape with large dark eyes, sinuous lines, and a gruesome mouth reminiscent of a jaw with the skin removed. Davriel uses a walking cane, with a sword hidden inside. \n\nDavriel is considered to be lazy and selfish. He is able to steal [[spell]]s from the minds of other wizards and keep them available for a limited period of time. His eyes change color whenever he uses one of these spells.  \n\nDavriel is primarily [[black]]-aligned but secondarily [[blue]].<ref name=\"color\">[https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/a5jf0s/children_of_the_nameless_by_brandon_sanderson_now/ebon5g0/ Comment by Mistborn a.k.a. Brandon Sanderson on Reddit]</ref>\n\n===Davriel's Entity===\nA [[Worldsoul]] Entity is hiding in Davriel's mind, promising him unlimited power if he surrenders control. It heals Davriel's wounds. It also possibly provided Davriel with his [[planeswalker's spark]].<ref name=\"AMA\"/> The Entity normally wanted him to draw upon it, use it for its true purpose — as a vast reservoir to power his spells. Spells that Davriel stole from the minds of others usually faded a few hours after he first employed them. Some lasted longer, and others vanished after a few minutes, particularly if he’d been holding them for a while before their first use. But with the Entity, he could make his stolen abilities last weeks under constant use.\n\nThe Entity was aware that [[Nicol Bolas|forces clashed]] in the [[Multiverse]], and that the boundaries between planes trembled. It expected the conflict to find Davriel and would have him ready and prepared, ready to rise up to claim the position that the Entity thought to be rightfully his. For this purpose the Entity had led the unaware Davriel to Innistrad, for it knew that [[The Bog Entity|another one of its kind]] was hiding on that plane.\n\nAfter Davriel refused to absorb the power of the second Entity, his own Entity proclaimed him unworthy and threatened to find another host. It also predicted that Davriel would curse himself when that which he loved burned, as he would lack the strength to stop his enemies.\n\n===On Davriel's spark===\nIt is unclear whether Davriel's [[spark]] is his own. It is possible that his planeswalking powers are granted by the [[Worldsoul#Plane-less worldsouls|Entity]].<ref name=\"AMA\">[https://www.reddit.com/r/brandonsanderson/comments/a5c95s/children_of_the_nameless_ama_with_brandon/ebqfa15/?context=8&depth=9 Children of the Nameless AMA]</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Origin===\nBefore his planeswalking days, Davriel was a young accountant from an unknown plane working ledgers for a partnership.\n[[File:Sap Vitality.jpg|thumb|267x267px|Davriel's magic focuses on temporarily stealing spells from others.]]\nEver since stealing the Entity — pulling it from the mind of a dying man — Davriel had been able to sense its vast potential. Davriel had used the power of the Entity only once, three years before his arrival on Innistrad. By that time in his life, he’d become comfortable with his powers — and with his strange ability to walk between different planes of existence. He’d spent years traveling, exploring, learning how enormous the [[multiverse]] was. He’d suffered enslavement and found vengeance. He’d become an expert at dealing with demons. At long last, he decided to claim himself a throne. It had been during that struggle — a desperate, climactic clash between armies and ideologies — that he’d finally relented, and drawn upon the Entity, which resulted in the destruction of both armies. \n\nStanding on that bloody field, Davriel had first sensed others hunting him. They’d arrived on the battlefield, drawn to the plane by his use of this power. He didn’t know who they were. Likely, they were allies of the dying man from whose mind Davriel had originally stolen the Entity. But he knew that whoever they were, they’d hunt him and destroy him. And so he fled.\n\nDavriel prefers a life of quiet comfort, but the dying man's allies have been hunting Davriel eversince he took the Entity. Staying one step ahead with the careful use of stolen spells, Davriel ensures his safety and, more important, his comfort, by entrapping demons with contracts so devious they can never collect. When the demons grow wise to his false bargains or his old enemies sniff him out, Davriel packs up again with great reluctance and finds a new [[plane]] with gullible demons to deal with.<ref name=\"Planes of Multiverse\">{{WikiRef|author=[[Jay Annelli]]|date=2021|title=Magic: The Gathering - Planes of the Multiverse|publisher=Abrams ComicArts}}</ref>\n\n===Innistrad===\n[[File:Davriel.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=|left]]\nDesiring to fade away into obscurity, he moved to Innistrad, a plane where consorting with demons was seen as only a minor oddity. Davriel arrived on Innistrad around 4559 [[AR]], about a year before the arrival of [[Emrakul]] and the madness of the [[angel]]s. He moved to the backwater of [[the Approaches]] - the most remote location on an already remote plane - and immediately removed the previous ruler, a [[vampire]] known as Lord [[List of secondary characters/Innistrad|Vaast]] of the [[Markov]] line. Because he valued his peace and quiet, and because of the remoteness of the Approaches, the Corruption of Innistrad went by him fairly unnoticed.\n\nDavriel was caught up in local events when the citizens of Verlasen were attacked by [[geist]]s, and the girl [[Tacenda]] blamed him for orchestrating that attack. They found out that an imposter had been using a copy of his mask and mantle. The church, equally thinking he was guilty, had sent several hunters and [[cathar]]s to kill him. Wanting to restore his peace and quiet, Davriel decided to help Tacenda to find the imposter and restore the souls of the villagers to their stiffened bodies.\n\nResearching the church of [[the Nameless Angel]], Tacenda and Davriel discovered that the people inside had been able to resist the attacks by the Whisperers, until a betrayer had let the geists in. As the Whisperers were unaffected by Tacenda's song but were stopped by the priests, Davriel reasoned that they were from the Bog. Additionally, he reasoned that the spirits that Tacenda had heard whispering were likely people from her own village. While at the church, a group of hunters and cathars from Thraben attacked the group, killing Davriel's demons Brerig and Yledris.\n\nDuring the investigation, Davriel began to suspect that Tacenda was more than she seemed. When he tried to steal her song magic, she was able to resist him. He questioned her if there was an entity, similar to his own, that talked to her. She denied this, but Davriel's Entity confirmed that she carried part of [[the Bog Entity]]. Not fully alive, it couldn't speak to her, except in the crudest of ways. It also confirmed that the majority of its power was supposed to be hidden in [[the Bog]]. Davriel's Entity urged Davriel to take the second Entity to become mighty enough that none would ever dare challenge him. However, investigating the Bog they found it to be empty, and they were besieged by a host of [[Spirit#Whisperers|Whisperers]] under control of Tacenda's twin sister [[Willia]].\n\nFleeing to the Priory again, Davriel and Tacenda found the body of the Nameless Angel, killed after it had been struck by [[Emrakul]]'s madness. Its soul still lingered and it encouraged Tacenda to use a new song. With this warm joyful song, Tacenda defeated the Whisperers and absorbed their souls. With the help of Davriel, she also overcame and killed Willia. Willia's body released its part of the Worldsoul, and the Bog Entity was made whole inside Tacenda. At the moment that Tacenda was overcome by her power, Davriel's Entity urged him to grab the power for himself. Unwilling to become a creature that only caused death and destruction, Davriel refused to do it. Not long after, Tacenda vanished into nothing.\n\nAs a result of these events, Davriel's presence became known to other planeswalkers, much to his chagrin. He was soon visited by a group of planeswalkers (possibly [[the Gatewatch]]) looking to recruit him to their cause. He also received a cryptic message, although no further details are known.<ref name=\"WAR\">{{WebRef|url=https://brandonsanderson.com/announcing-davriels-magic-the-gathering-cards/|title=Announcing Davriel’s Magic: The Gathering Cards|author=Brandon Sanderson|date=April 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===War of the Spark===\nDavriel was lured to [[Ravnica]] by the [[Interplanar Beacon]], and immediately became trapped there due to [[Bolas]]'s use of the [[Immortal Sun]]. While he had no interest in the [[War of the Spark (event)|conflict]], he showed up just to make the other planeswalkers believe he was useless in a fight, hoping that would get them to leave him alone in the future. Rather than participate in the battle, he attempted to join a party being thrown by an [[Orzhov]] [[vampire]] who was celebrating the bloodshed. He also considered selling his soul to [[Rakdos]].<ref name=\"WAR\" />\n\nDuring the invasion, the trapped planeswalkers (including Davriel) met with Ravnican leaders to strategize. At the meeting, Davriel tried to buddy up with Ob Nixilis, although his motives were unclear.<ref name=\"Magic Story\">{{WebRef|url=https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-story/war-spark-ravnica-rallying-reluctant-2019-05-22|title=War of the Spark: Ravnica – Rallying the Reluctant|author=Greg Weisman|date=May 22, 2019}}</ref> In spite of his earlier inhibitions, he ended up joining the battle: Alongside many other planeswalkers and Ravnicans, he fought against the [[Eternal]]s of Bolas' [[Dreadhorde]].<ref name=\"Weisman Ravnica novel\">[[Greg Weisman]] (April 2019). \"''[[War of the Spark: Ravnica]]''\". Del Rey.</ref> He led an army of demons and devils alongside the half-[[devil]] [[Tibalt]].

They serve him until they are able to reap his soul via certain conditions within the contracts. However, unbeknownst to the demons, Davriel has engineered these stipulations such that they are nigh impossible to fulfill. These demons include, but are not limited to: \n*[[List of secondary characters/Innistrad|Voluptara]] (a.k.a. ''Miss Highwater''). Known as one of the most dangerous and wily of demons of the Nexrix Flame Expanse, she now works for Davriel as his accountant. Notably, she is the demon that Davriel interacts with the most within the novella [[Children of the Nameless]], the first demon Davriel summoned on Innistrad, and the demon given the most control over his business dealings as Lord of the Manor. She wears a fitted grey jacket over a simple knee-length skirt and her black hair in a bun. She has ashen grey skin and dark red eyes, with small horns peeking up through her hair. In order to obtain Davriel's soul, she has to successfully seduce Davriel. However, he has never presented a hint of attraction towards her even though Miss Highwater has mentioned that she has had a history of successfully seducing both men and women. When Davriel suggests that he simply is not interested in women, Miss Highwater objects that she is not that \"oblivious\" and remarks that Davriel is \"something else entirely.\"<ref name=\"Children\" />\n*[[List of secondary characters/Innistrad|Crunchgnar]]. A tall, muscular, wingless, and hairless Hartmurt demon. His inhuman features include horns swept back along with his head almost like a mane. Quick to heal and a skilled combatant, he wears a warrior’s leather and a pair of wicked swords strapped to his waist. As his designated bodyguard, Crunchgnar earns Davriel's soul if Davriel doesn't die before age 65 {{-}} but Davriel had already died before meeting the demon.\n*[[List of secondary characters/Innistrad|Brerig]]. A hunched demon with a twisted figure, and features that vaguely resembled a hairless dog’s snout. He has black wings jutting out of his back, though they are gnarled and withered. To gain Davriel's soul, Brerig had to solve a riddle: \"What am I thinking of, right now?\" While Brerig gets five chances a day and the answer was set at the time of signing, the answer is so esoteric as to be nearly unguessable: a particular random rock from [[Cabralin]]. Miss Highwater notes that Brerig enjoys serving a long-term master, implying he may not have earnestly tried to answer the riddle.\n*[[List of secondary characters/Innistrad|Gutmorn]] and [[List of secondary characters/Innistrad|Yledris]]. A pair of lightly armored Nightreach demons, with skeletal features, long, goat-like legs, and enormous wings. The two claim to be brother and sister because they were created on the same day. Their stipulation has not been explicitly specified though one may presume it has also been crafted with Davriel's guile.\n\nHe has showed an open interest in trying to recruit [[Ob Nixilis]].<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/war-spark-ravnica-rallying-reluctant-2019-05-22|War of the Spark: Ravnica – Rallying the Reluctant|[[Greg Weisman]]|May 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Planeswalkers met ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n*[[Angrath]]\n*[[Chandra Nalaar]]<ref name=\"Magic 11\">MacKay, Jed.

      "raw_content": "{{Infobox character\n|image=Domri Rade.jpg\n|name=Domri Rade\n|birthplace= The [[Ravnica#Geography|Rubblebelt]], [[Ravnica]]\n|lifetime= [[Mending Era]]\n|death= 4560 [[AR]]\n|race=[[Human]] [[Planeswalker (lore)|Planeswalker]]\n|colors = Center: {{mana|RG}}\n|lore=Domri\n}}\n'''Domri Rade''' was a [[human]] [[shaman]] [[Planeswalker (lore)|planeswalker]] and a member of the [[Gruul Clans]].<ref>[http://magic.wizards.com/en/story/planeswalkers/domri-rade Planeswalkers: Domri Rade] {{-}} Wizards of the Coast</ref> He wasn't always a member of the Gruul, having been orphaned to the streets and ruins of Ravnica before he could even remember.\n\n== Appearance and characteristics ==\nDomri Rade was a chaotic power-hungry individual. He always admired the Gruul ways of life and wanted to become a part of them. The young, diminutive [[shaman]] always felt like he had something to prove in a guild dominated by hulking brutes.<ref name=\"Planes of Multiverse\">{{WikiRef|author=[[Jay Annelli]]|date=2021|title=Magic: The Gathering - Planes of the Multiverse|publisher=Abrams ComicArts}}</ref> Through his desire, Bolas found him an easy target to manipulate for his plans during the War of the Spark. He takes great joy in destroying the architecture of Ravnica, embodying the fundamental goal of the Gruul clans wholeheartedly. \n\nDuring the War of the Spark, Domri showed a bit of naivety by thinking Bolas would allow him to join his side, simply because both wanted to destroy Ravnica. During his untimely demise, he revealed an almost child-like mentality, begging for forgiveness as the dragon ruthlessly stole his spark and cast his empty shell aside.\n\nDomri Rade was centered in [[green]] and [[red]] [[mana]]. Through his shamanic magic he could [[summon]] and command great [[beast]]s.\n\n==History==\n===Joining the Gruul===\nDomri was orphaned and abandoned in what remained of Ravnica's wilds at a young age.<ref name=\"RNAGuide\">(2019). ''[https://archive.org/details/RavnicaAllegiancePlayersGuide Ravnica Allegiance Player's Guide].'' [[Wizards of the Coast]].</ref> He had always admired the Gruul, idolizing them for having the guts to fight the powers that he had to deal with every day in his adolescence. Unfortunately, he was too small and wiry for any clan of the Gruul to claim him. Rejected, but not dejected, he continued to strive to be what the Gruul wanted. Without a clan to call his own, he found companionship in the feral beasts of the ruins he called home. He developed an affinity for them, the first stirring of magic that he could claim as his own.\n\nThis skill would finally earn him his long desired place among the Gruul. When the [[Orzhov Syndicate]] pushed into the Rubblebelt, Domri commanded a herd of ragebeasts into driving them out, a feat that earned the eye of the Guildmaster himself, [[Borborygmos]]. The cyclops declared Domri an honorary member of the Burning Tree clan.\n\n===Rite of Passage===\n[[File:Ragefire.jpg|thumb|247x247px|''“Your precious laws can’t save you now!”''|alt=]]\nHis life was normal amongst the clans, pretend fighting with his best friends Whip and Lakkie, further smashing the ruins of the Rubblebelt, and in general being a nuisance to everyone he encountered. It was a mundane life, but all that changed when he underwent the Gruul rite of passage. It all changed when it came time for him to be buried alive.\n\nTeenage bravado led him to brag to his friends, but as the shaman of his clan led him further from his Rubblebelt home, he began to fret more and more. Reaching [[Utvara]], they prepared him with the ritual magic to keep his body alive, but his mind was left unprotected. As the dirt fell upon him, all the boy's bluster fled and panic set in. He clung to what he knew, prayed to the old gods for deliverance, and struggled as hard as he could under the crushing weight of the cold earth. It was then, in the darkness, that his eyes were opened. \n\nHe awoke under the [[Naya]]n skies, confused but happy to be alive. He was amazed at the lush, untamed growth of the world around him, and in his exuberance called out... gaining the notice of a Gargantuan and nearly getting himself killed. It was only thanks to the timely intervention of a group of [[Cylia]]n godtrackers that he survived. He babbled to them about his own world, and the more he thought of his home, the more real his vision became until at last, he was pulled once more through the [[Blind Eternities]] to his homeworld.[[File:Domri Rade2.jpg|left|thumb|243x243px|Domri becomes Guildmaster without knowing he was a pawn for Nicol Bolas]]\n\n===Ravnica Allegiance===\nWith the help of Bolas he rose up through the ranks of the Gruul, becoming the [[guildmaster]] by defeating the [[cyclops]] [[Borborygmos]].<ref name=\"Chapter Twelve\">[[Django Wexler]] (August 28, 2019), ''[[The Gathering Storm]]'', Chapter Twelve.</ref> The [[shaman]] [[Nikya]] saw his ascension as the first sign of the coming of the [[End-Raze]].<ref>[[James Wyatt]] (January 2019). \"''[[The Art of Magic: The Gathering - Ravnica]]'''\".

He amassed an enormous mob to rampage through the city streets, making sure that every guild suffered painful losses to keep them at each other's throats.\n\n===War of the Spark===\n[[File:Spark-harvest-war--art-mtga.png|thumb|Domri Rade's death|267x267px]]\nWhen the [[War of the Spark (event)|War of the Spark]] started, Domri initially was fighting against the [[Eternal]]s and even helped save [[Kaya]] in a tight spot.<ref name=\"Weisman Ravnica novel\">[[Greg Weisman]] (April 2019). \"''[[War of the Spark: Ravnica]]''\".

His suit was partially encased in whorls and filigrees of brass, bits of which hissed and ticked faintly as he moved. Baan had an innate talent, heightened by magic, that allowed him to see the flaws in any system or machine. After mere moments of scrutiny, Dovin could provide a complete analysis, noting a particular machine's weaknesses, highlighting its shortcomings, and predicting with startling accuracy exactly how and when it will fail.<ref>[http://magic.wizards.com/en/story/planeswalkers/dovin-baan Dovin Baan]</ref> He can do this for a machine, a bureaucracy, a dance — the form matters little, only the process. Consequently, he could perfect the thing, little by little, until it became a true exemplar of what it was meant to be.<ref name=\"Chapter Eight\">[[Django Wexler]] (July 31, 2019), ''[[The Gathering Storm]]'', Chapter Eight.</ref>\n\nBaan's favorite tools were [[thopter]]s, small flying mechanical spy devices.\n\nDovin Baan was centered in both [[white]] and [[blue]] mana. When he planeswalked, he vanished in a sideways movement.\n\n==History==\n===Kaladesh===\nDovin Baan was the Minister of Inspections of the [[Consulate]] of Kaladesh. His admirable success made him serve as senior inspector of the [[Inventors' Fair]].\n\nWhen he came up against an [[renegades|unexpected and unpredictable renegade threat]], he requested the aid of the [[Gatewatch]]. The Gatewatch had to refuse to assist Baan, considering his problems an internal affair and antithetical to the goals of their organization. However, his visit alerted [[Chandra Nalaar]] of the events happening on Kaladesh, her plane of birth, and she immediately planeswalked to Kaladesh with [[Liliana Vess]].<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/homesick-2016-08-29|Homesick|[[Chris L'Etoile]]|August 29, 2016}}</ref> Baan returned to Kaladesh, [[Nissa]] in tow. He arrived next to [[Tezzeret]], as he was arresting [[Pia Nalaar|Renegade Prime]], later to be revealed as Chandra's mother, [[Pia Nalaar]]. Recognizing Chandra in the crowd, Dovin Baan ordered gearhulks to be brought into a position to isolate and contain Chandra from Renegade Prime. Renegade Prime, however, relented and let herself be taken into custody. Baan was relieved, having arrested Renegade Prime, and serving a blow to the renegade threat he sought to quell.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/renegade-prime-2016-09-14|Renegade Prime|[[Mel Li]]|September 14, 2016}}</ref>[[File:Dovin Baan3.jpg|left|thumb|Dovin Baan sabotages the [[Renegades]]' plan and is expelled by the flames of Chandra|304x304px]] During [[Tezzeret]]'s coup, Dovin Baan hesitantly cooperated, although he disliked the draconian manner in which the inventions were taken from the inventors. Tezzeret assured him that this was solely done for protecting the inventions since he expected a major Renegade retaliation, and to develop them further to usher in a new era of innovation. Tezzeret then revealed that he intended to make Dovin the head of the institution that would manufacture these new, streamlined inventions and make them public among the population of Kaladesh. In exchange, [[Tezzeret]] demanded that Dovin Baan take care of the Gatewatch since it was due to his invitation that they were here. Baan immediately went to assemble a group of elite [[soldier]]s, intending to use the weaknesses and dysfunctions of the Gatewatch against them.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/grateful-consulate-2016-10-19|A Grateful Consulate|[[James Wyatt]]|October 19, 2016}}</ref> After the Renegades had managed to conquer the central Aether Hub of the city, Tezzeret ordered Baan on the ''<c title=\"Skysovereign\">Skysovereign, Consul Flagship</c>'' to help construct his battle plans. After examining the situation, Baan pointed out that the majority of the Renegades, under them Renegade Prime, had taken up residence in the hub and that a direct attack would inevitably fail. Instead, he advised to encircle the facility and draw out their commanders, including the [[Planeswalker (lore)|planeswalker]]s, and then strike with aerial support and various armored inspectors. Listing the weaknesses of the Gatewatch, Baan stated that the weakest link of the group was Chandra Nalaar, due to her impulsiveness. [[Tezzeret]] then ordered [[Baral]] to distract Chandra, exploiting the hatred that existed between both. Baan was wary of this plan since he mistrusted Baral's soundness of mind. \n\nTezzeret ordered Baan to supervise the operation. Insisting that their confrontation would take place in one of the more dilapidated quarters of [[Ghirapur]], he watched the battle between the [[Consulate]] officer and the planeswalkers. When Baral wanted more firepower against them, Baan refused, wanting to keep the citizenry safe from collateral damage. During the battle, Baan heard Baral provoking Chandra, admitting that Kiran and Pia Nalaar had not died in the fire, as he previously stated, but that Kiran had been murdered by Baral himself and Pia was taken into the Dhund without a trial. Charging the officer with murder, attempted murder, and multiple counts of falsification of the public record, Baan ordered Baral's imprisonment. The renegades escaped the encounter at the Aether Hub. As Baral protested and urged Baan to pursue the renegades, Baan informed him that the central Aether Hub was again under Consulate control.<ref name=\"Burn\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/burn|Burn|[[Chris L'Etoile]]|January 4, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Renegades]] attacked the [[Ghirapur#Location|Consulate's Spire]], Baan boarded the [[Heart of Kiran]] and sabotaged the [[Hope of Ghirapur]], which was an essential part of their strategy. He then planeswalked away before Chandra could stop him.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/breaking-points-2017-01-18|Breaking Points|[[Doug Beyer]]|January 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Ravnica===\n[[File:Dovin Baan, Grand Arbiter.jpg|left|thumb|327x327px|Guildmaster.]]\nAfter realizing that Tezzeret was not the true mastermind behind the [[Planar Bridge]], Baan decided to look for Tezzeret's master. Walking right into [[Bolas]] claws, he was taken in by the dragon's intelligence and \"flawless planning\". Bolas then offered Dovin something Dovin couldn't turn down, the chance to reshape a plane into flawless and ordered efficiency. Since his first visit to Ravnica to recruit the Gatewatch, Dovin had itched to improve the guild system, so he willingly jumped at the chance to take over the [[Azorius Senate]] on Ravnica.<ref name=\"Art book\">[[James Wyatt]] (January 2019). \"''[[The Art of Magic: The Gathering - Ravnica]]'''\". [[Wizards of the Coast]]</ref> Manipulating the system from the inside, he exploited one loophole after another to disrupt the chain of command.  Occupying judges and senators with often overlooked (but technically required by law) paperwork, rescheduling key meetings, and arranging the ousting of people in key positions of power, Dovin emerged as the new head of the Lyev Column, replacing the unpopular hussar [[List of secondary characters/Ravnica|Agmand Sarv]].<ref name=\"Chapter Three\">[[Django Wexler]] (June 19, 2019), ''[[The Gathering Storm]], Chapter Three''.</ref> When [[Isperia]] was killed by [[Vraska]],<ref name=\"Chapter Ten\">[[Django Wexler]] (August 14, 2019), ''[[The Gathering Storm]]'', Chapter Ten.</ref> Dovin took over as [[guildmaster]] and showed the guild how to make spy [[thopter]]s and to use [[precognitive mage]]s to arrest people before crimes would be committed. \n\nWhen [[Ral Zarek]] altered the [[Implicit Maze]]  to fulfill Niv-Mizzet's plan of stealing the power of the [[Guildpact (spell)|Guildpact]], Dovin found out and played along until right before Bolas's arrival on the plane and then sabotaged the device, leaving Jace as the [[Living Guildpact]].<ref name=\"Art book\"/>\n\n===War of the Spark===\n[[File:LazavDovinManga.png|thumb|[[Lazav]], in disguise as [[Chandra Nalaar]], blinds Dovin.]]\nIn the [[War of the Spark (event)|War of the Spark]], Dovin guarded the [[Immortal Sun]] for Bolas. During a fight, he was overpowered by [[Chandra Nalaar]], who turned out to be the Dimir guildmaster [[Lazav]] in disguise, using an [[Izzet League]] flamethrower.<ref><c>Chandra's Triumph</c></ref> Lazav threw throwing stars that hit Dovin in the eyes and blinded him.<ref name=\"Weisman Ravnica novel\">[[Greg Weisman]] (April 2019). \"''[[War of the Spark: Ravnica]]''\". Del Rey</ref> This seriously affected his ability to detect weakness in others. Bleeding, he planeswalked away shortly afterward.\n\nThe new [[Living Guildpact]], [[Niv-Mizzet]], later hired [[Vraska]] to track Baan down.\n\n===Death===\nAfter being blinded by Lazav, Dovin Baan planeswalked to his home on [[Kaladesh (plane)|Kaladesh]] but soon returned to his safe house on [[Ravnica]].<ref name=\"Forsaken\">[[Greg Weisman]] (November 2019). \"''[[War of the Spark: Forsaken]].''\" Del Rey.</ref> There he managed to lead a fairly regular life thanks to his eidetic memory and started to manufacture appliances to replace his lost eyes. On Ravnica, he was discovered by Vraska, and in exchange for his life, Baan offered to help her retain control over the [[Golgari]]. Vraska accepted the offer and together they plotted to fake Baan's death. Using a statue replica of himself, a fight was staged in Zinara on [[Regatha]] with [[Chandra Nalaar]] being an unsuspecting accomplice. During the fight, Vraska severed Baan’s right hand to use as proof of a kill while Chandra believed she had delivered the killing blow. The plan succeeded and Baan returned to Ravnica, only to be assassinated by [[Araithia Shokta|Atkos Tarr]] who had been sent by Lazav in his plans to blackmail Vraska. After his death, Atkos removed Baan’s left hand and secretly passed it on to Lazav.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the video game ''[[Magic: The Gathering Arena]]'', Dovin is voiced by [[Wikipedia:Robin Atkin Downes|Robin Atkin Downes]].<ref>{{WebRef|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10967214/characters/nm0235960|title=Robin Atkin Downes as Dovin Baan|publisher=IMDB}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Dovin Baan5.jpg|Supreme Judge.\nFile:Dovin, Architect of Law.jpg|''“If the populace fears our authority, then I’d say we have an appropriately sensible populace.”''\nFile:Dovin's Veto.jpg|Dovin's Veto.\nFile:Dovin-Hand-of-Control.jpg|Keeping the Immortal Sun.\nFile:Dovin Baan4.jpg|Minion of Nicol Bolas.\nFile:DovinManga.png|Dovin in the ''[[Ravnica Allegiance]]'' [[manga]].\nFile:Dovin Baan MTGA avatar RNA.png|[[Magic: The Gathering Arena]] avatar.\n</gallery>\n\n==Planeswalkers met==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n*[[Chandra Nalaar]]\n*[[Domri Rade]]\n*[[Gideon Jura]]\n*[[Jace Beleren]]\n*[[Liliana Vess]]\n*[[Nicol Bolas]]\n*[[Nissa Revane]]\n*[[Ral Zarek]]\n*[[Saheeli Rai]]\n*[[Tezzeret]]\n*[[Vraska]]\n}}\n\n==Planes visited==\n*[[Kaladesh (plane)|Kaladesh]]\n*[[Ravnica]]\n*[[Regatha]]<ref name=\"Forsaken\"/>\n\n==Story appearances==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

She usually wore tight black leggings with snake motifs coiling around them, an embroidered vest with inlays of ivory, a jacket, a silken neck scarf, and gleaming beads braided into her short-shorn hair. Her voice was deep and self-assured, her eyes piercing, and her smile a little mocking.<ref name=Thran>[[J. Robert King]], 1999, ''[[The Thran]]'', [[Wizards of the Coast]].</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Aiding Yawgmoth===\nFive millennia before the Brothers' War, Dyfed visited [[Glacian]], the master artificer of the [[Thran Empire]], wanting to meet the genius who had proven the existence of the [[Multiverse]] by demonstrating its mathematical necessity.  She was aware of his latent planeswalker nature.  Yawgmoth, then the most important healer of the empire, walked in on the meeting and, after discovering Dyfed's powers, managed to talk the planeswalker into aiding him.  Dyfed fell for the charming words of Yawgmoth and agreed to find a [[plane]] where Yawgmoth could build a paradise for all the Thran.  She even gifted him with a special amulet, to call on her for help.\n\n===Creating the portal to Phyrexia===\nAfter Yawgmoth forcibly took control of the [[Thran Empire]], [[Rebbec]] and Glacian summoned Dyfed, hoping to convince her to rescue the elders of the empire, whom Yawgmoth had imprisoned.  Dyfed agreed to help Glacian, and took the elders, along with several [[goblin]] servants, to the plane of [[Mercadia]], where they would become the ancestors of the Mercadians and the [[Goblin#Mercadian Goblins|Kyren]].  Sometime later, as Yawgmoth amassed more and more power, but also drove the empire to war with the people of nations he had harmed in the past, Dyfed opened a permanent [[planar portal|portal]] from [[Dominaria (plane)|Dominaria]] to [[Phyrexia]], the metal plane which Yawgmoth wanted to make his paradise.  Thanks to Dyfed, Yawgmoth could enter the core of Phyrexia, fusing himself with the plane and becoming its god.\n\n===Death===\nDuring the [[Thran-Phyrexian War]], Dyfed planeswalked to Phyrexia to put an end to Yawgmoth's plans.  There she met with Yawgmoth, accusing him of having spread lies about the [[phthisis]] and using the illness as a way to eliminate his enemies. Regretting the help she had given him, Dyfed ordered Yawgmoth to step down from his position, surrender to the Thran Alliance, and free their delegates.  Yawgmoth at first seemed to yield to Dyfed and agreed to free the delegates. However, when the ruler of Phyrexia showed Dyfed the terrible experiments he had used the delegates for, she was utterly shocked.  Yawgmoth, taking advantage of Dyfed's horror, stabbed her in the skull with a [[powerstone]] blade that scrambled her brain, preventing her from forming a coherent thought and, consequently, from planeswalking away.  Yawgmoth had his minions vivisect her, hoping to find an organ that enabled planeswalking which he could transplant into himself.  However, before any such organ could be discovered, Rebbec found the tortured planeswalker and killed the priests working on her, allowing Dyfed to finally die.\n\n==Story appearances==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\"\n|-\n!Title!!Author!!Publishing date!!Set!!Setting (plane)!!Featuring\n|-\n| ''[[The Thran]]'' || [[J.

When she was thirteen years old, she and her mother were captured by [[Phyrexia|Phyrexians]] and held in prison a stone's throw from her childhood village.<ref>{{WebRef|url=https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/the-magic-story-podcast-returns|title=Phyrexia: All Will Be One #16: Impossible Odds|work=The Magic Story Podcast|author=[[Harless Snyder]] and [[Natalie Kreider]]|date=May 1, 2023}}</ref><ref name=\"AlaraGuide\"/> She would pray to Serra despite the Phyrexians forbade her name from being spoken.\n\nIn this prison, the Phyrexians of her homeworld tended to those of their numbers they felt insane.

Kept in the cells for more than a week, her mother's throat was torn out in front of her by a Phyrexian.<ref name=\"Last to Leave\"/> She and \"[[List of secondary characters#Capenna|Boy]]\" attempted to smuggle themselves out of the facility by hiding under a pile of corpses, unaware that the stench of decay was attractive to unholy ''[[compleat]]'' Phyrexians.  Upon being discovered and restrained for vivisection, her [[Planeswalker's spark]] ignited and she planeswalked away,<ref name=\"The Dark\"/> landing on [[Theros (plane)|Theros]]. She spent the next few years of her young life seeking a safe place, suffering unknown hardships until finally, she stumbled across [[Bant]].\n\n===The Alaran Paradise===\nIn Bant, Elspeth found everything that was missing from her life: community, love, and most importantly, peace. At sixteen, she was training and eager to become a Knight of Bant.<ref>[[Theros: Godsend, Part I]], Chapter 8</ref> She settled in the nation of [[Valeron]], and at seventeen she began her training as a squire.<ref name=\"The Dark\"/><ref name=\"AlaraGuide\">[[Doug Beyer]] & [[Jenna Helland]] (2008). ''[[A Planeswalker's Guide to Alara]]'', [[Wizards of the Coast]]. ISBN-13 978-0786951246</ref> In three years she was knighted, younger than almost anyone. Her fellow knights did not know her ability to planeswalk or of her origins, she kept the nature of her origin and abilities secret and allayed any question concerning her birthplace, only admitting to not being from Valeron. In time, she earned more sigils than any other member.<ref>[[Jenna Helland]] (2009), \"''[[Honor Bound]]''\", [[Wizards of the Coast]]</ref>\n\nOne day, two years after she had last used her abilities, her peaceful idyll was shattered when the broken body of a planeswalker crashed down near her outpost. With the help of Bant's balmgivers and [[Rhox]] monks, she nursed [[Ajani Goldmane]] back to health. Given his condition upon arrival, she thought she had found a kindred spirit and sought to convince him to stay upon Bant. Unfortunately, after a confrontation, she was rudely proven wrong. Ajani left with only a dire warning that their worlds were closer than she thought.\n\nAfter this warning, her mind was continually troubled. Concerned with some distressing rumors she had heard, she went out with her squire [[Aran]] to search for evidence. At a Rhox monastery, they found a [[Grixis]] incursion zone. The [[Conflux (event)|Conflux]] had begun for Elspeth. She rushed back to the castle she served and took part in a disastrous defense of her home. Aran fell to the enemy, and something in Elspeth finally broke. She cast aside all the rules of civil warfare that Bant cherished and unleashed her full powers, devastating her enemies and bringing Aran back to life. All the castle members looked at her with newfound respect and admiration, but she felt their eyes showed expectation and accusation as if she had betrayed them somehow. She stripped herself of her sigils, feeling they were a weight too heavy to bear.\n\nHer rank was not so easily given up though. She still led her platoon under the Knight-General [[Rafiq]] during the battle of [[Jhess]] to drive the invading forces of [[Esper]] away but was brought low by the command of an Esper mage. As a result of her injuries, she was no longer allowed to fight on the front lines, but she refused to let Bant suffer in strife. She sought some way to help and with that mind, she interrogated [[Gwafa Hazid]] in hopes of learning who had manipulated the events behind the destruction of Giltspire Castle, which marked the start of the problems on Bant. What she learned shocked her, and she went to the assembled forces at the ruins of Giltspire Castle in hopes of defending it. Ultimately, she assisted Rafiq in killing [[Malfegor]], effectively ending Bant's part in the Conflux war.\n\nDespite how hard she had fought, her feelings had still been inexorably changed. She was brutally reminded that Alara was not her world, and she had no right to the position they had asked of her. Worst of all, Bant had been changed forever and was no longer the plane she cherished. With a heavy heart, she planeswalked away.\n\n===Vengeance and Redemption===\n[[File:Elspeth Tirel3.jpg|thumb|Elspeth seeking meaning to the warning|260x260px]]\nElspeth's self-imposed exile brought her back to familiar grounds. She had spent some time in [[Urborg]] as a youth and she chose to return there, wallowing in her grief and anger.<ref name=\"Gathering Forces\">[[Jenna Helland]] (2010), \"''[[Gathering Forces]]''\", [[Wizards of the Coast]]</ref> The environment suited her mood and to make enough money to eat, and perhaps to satisfy her fury, she began fighting in gladiatorial pits, misusing her training as a knight to win. It was in one such match that Ajani once again found her. The appearance of the leonin distracted her [[Koth|opponent]] enough that he dropped his guard, allowing her to land a strike that revealed a familiar [[Phyrexia#The Phyrexian Symbol|mark]] from her past on the warrior's body. Instantly enraged, she sought to strike down her foe, and only the timely intervention of her old friend managed to save him.\n\nAfter the match, Ajani informed Elspeth that he had been tracking her, hoping to convince her to return to Bant. He scolded her, telling her there was no honor in what she was doing, that ultimately she could still help Bant if she would return, and that she was wasted in a wretched place like Urborg. His pleas fell on deaf ears. Elspeth was without hope and she sent him away, telling him there was no point in fighting what was inevitable. Saddened, Ajani left, bestowing one last kindness upon her. He returned the armor she had left on Bant after Malfegor's fall, the armor she thought herself unworthy to wear.\n\nLater that night, Elspeth found Koth. He demanded to know where she knew of his mark and she refused. He told her of the mark, that it was a reminder of the people of his plane, of those who had fallen to the Phyrexians, and his vow to stop them. The next morning, Koth took Elspeth to a ruined structure called The Tomb of Flesh. They spoke of their homes, of the places they cherished, and once more Elspeth lamented Bant's fate. Koth used his [[Wizard#Specialties|geomancy]] to create a path to the tomb and conjuring a light, Elspeth saw a haunting image from her past, and once more, terrified and chilled, she fled from the dark corners of the world.\n\nKoth found her once more at the ruins of a castle and asked her to come with him to [[Martyrs' Tomb|The Heroes' Memorial]]. Once there, he gifted her with gems, telling her to trap her fear in them, but she simply stated that the past is not so easily forgotten. Here in the temple, Koth communed with the stone altar and learned only one thing: They must find [[Venser]]. The artificer was not hard to find, being a long-standing target for the [[Windgrace Acolytes|acolytes]] who tended the memorial. The pair went to see Venser and the pair were shocked to find a Phyrexian vessel being rebuilt, improved in fact, to act as a planeshifting ship. When it became obvious Venser had no idea the powers he was meddling with, Koth flew into a rage and encased his head in a stone mask, coercing him to walk to Mirrodin. Elspeth was appalled at the sudden violent act, but Koth did not care, stating simply that he had no choice. He appealed to her once more to come and help him, to atone for her mistake. He did not wait for her answer, leaving her to make the decision herself.\n\n===The Quest for Karn===\n[[File:Elspeth Tirel2.jpg|thumb|Elspeth's Blinding Radiance|310x310px]]\nElspeth followed Koth with his erstwhile guest, finally seeing the lands the [[Vulshok]] called home. Despite his dire warnings, she saw nothing particularly threatening and Venser continued his tirade against the geomancer. Koth broke off his argument with Venser long enough to tell the pair of the conflicts raging across the surface, and of the dark threat that threatened the plane itself. Koth sought an old friend to help him tell them of the true enemy, but what he found was the surprising spread of the [[Mephidross]], stretching farther than he could have expected.<ref>[[Doug Beyer]] (2011), \"''[[Scarred]]''\", [[Wizards of the Coast]]</ref> The trio looked for Koth's acquaintance but they were ambushed by a group of [[nim]]. The companions quickly fought off the [[nim]], but once again the dark images of Elspeth's past loomed in her mind, and with a doleful sigh, she told the arguing walkers that she could not go any further.\n\nSeparating herself from her companions, Elspeth wandered until a Vulshok shaman took her in. The two conversed, and Elspeth once again lost herself in her past. This malaise did not go unnoticed, and the Vulshok berated Elspeth for her cowardice, telling her that she should be struck down for ignoring the enemies before her. Elspeth lamented that it would take more than her death to stay the Phyrexian infection. The Vulshok told the knight that if her word is worth anything, she should be fighting instead of talking.\n\nThese words took root within Elspeth, and she quickly found herself drawn to the source of the Phyrexian forces, [[Ish Sah]]. From here though, she learned her companions had not been so fortunate as she had. Tracking their location, she made her way to where they were held and cut a swath of destruction to them. With her sudden reappearance, the trio overwhelmed their captors and made good their escape. She prepared to finally put her fears to rest, not knowing the sheer number of the forces arrayed against them.\n\nElspeth, Venser, and Koth traveled to the Vault of Whispers, where they witnessed the emergence of a Phyrexian army that was invading the surface. During their observation, Elspeth froze when being in such proximity to the Phyrexians, which brought back memories of her captivity, and almost got captured. After several hours, the army passed, and the three companions entered the Vault, following a Myr secretly sent by [[Tezzeret]] to guide them. It led them to [[Geth]], and in secret, they followed him into the interior of the world. They came upon a butchering room in which they engaged massive Phyrexian butchers; Elspeth slew many, but they were outnumbered and managed to escape further into Mirrodin's underground through a meat shaft. When they emerged from the shaft they encountered [[Ezuri]], leader of a band of Mirran rebels. While Venser insisted that they had to continue to find Karn, Ezuri said that he could allow them to go no further. He revealed that the Phyrexian invasion had profited him greatly, catapulting him into a heroic leadership position that he loathed to give up. When Elspeth threatened Ezuri, however, the elf backed down and his followers fled after a display of Venser's meager magics. The companions continued further towards Mirrodin's core, eventually being met by Tezzeret.\n\nTezzeret led the companions to a surgery room, where Elspeth, angered by the sight of Phyrexians experimenting on creatures, flew into a rage, slaying all the Phyrexians in the room in a matter of moments. They freed [[Melira]], a Mirran born without any metal on her body, from the cages. Tezzeret said this was his gift to them; she was completely immune to [[phyresis]]. During the subsequent travels, Elspeth grew very protective of Melira. They began traveling back towards the surface but were surrounded and attacked by a massive force of Phyrexians. During the battle, Elspeth was the center of the Phyrexians' attention, slaying most of them and creating piles of dead around her so high that the other companions lost sight of her.\n[[File:Koth and Elspeth.jpg|thumb|Koth and Elspeth|279x279px|alt=|left]]\n\nThe companions eventually reached the furnace layer where the Phyrexians ignored any Mirran survivors, and found Ezuri's rebel camp. There they were welcomed despite their previous encounter, and Melira's ability to heal phyresis was discovered. She healed all those in the camp who were infected by the [[glistening oil]], healing non-stop for several days while Elspeth sat with her in the tent, speaking to her. Once everyone in the camp was healed, a council was called in which Ezuri, hoping to become more influential, invited Melira to stay with them while subtly telling the companions to leave. Melira said she would leave with the companions, and Elspeth and the others prepared to leave for the core to try to find Karn. While they were leaving, the camp was attacked by Tezzeret's Phyrexians, and the companions found a guide to take them further. They escaped the battle and followed the guide, whom only Elspeth trusted. After some time, Koth, angry at their lack of progress about the surface war, took Melira and left, leaving Venser and Elspeth alone with the guide. They hurried after Koth but were ambushed by Tezzeret's Phyrexians. Elspeth went into a battle fury, wiping out the massive force, but just as she killed the last of them, an even larger force appeared.\n\nThe Phyrexians carried the Planeswalkers away, but while their captors were trying to figure out how to access a doorway, Koth and Melira reappeared and freed the pair. By the time the Phyrexians realized that their captives were gone, the companions were already running. Venser's strength, however, was wearing thin and they were forced to stop. He concocted an explosive from the metal on the walls to blow up part of the tunnel which sealed it temporarily, but it was only a matter of time before a group of Phyrexians led by Glissa broke through. While she was taunting them, Tezzeret appeared and his forces did battle with Glissa's, allowing the companions to escape and reach Karn's throne room uninterrupted. There, they found Karn corrupted by the [[Phyrexian oil]], and Melira told the companions that his heart was corrupted. Venser told the others that he was already dying, had been for years, and that he was likely unable to last much longer. With his last strength, Venser gave his life and spark to Karn, curing the golem. Cured and lucid once again, Karn spoke with Elspeth, who told him that he could not kill all the Phyrexians. Karn replied that he knew, and that is why he needed their help. He asked them to begin organizing and leading the resistance with Melira to try to cleanse Mirrodin, no matter how long it would take. Purposefully and ready for the long battle ahead, the group left the throne room and headed back toward the surface to begin their war.\n\n===Mirrodin Falls===\nThe war on [[New Phyrexia (plane)|New Phyrexia]] failed miserably. [[Elesh Norn]] gained an increasing influence over the other praetor's forces and eventually seized power over [[Sheoldred]] and [[Urabrask]]'s territories. This led to the slaughter of the resistance, and in a last-ditch attempt, the remainder of their forces pooled together to strike at the hierarchy while that gesture might still have meaning. Koth led a force to plant a highly destructive spellbomb at a gathering of the praetors, but the mission went awry nearly as soon as it began. Their forces were decimated to the point that Elspeth wondered if she and [[Koth]] were the last \"natural\" beings on the plane. Surrounded by the Praetor's forces, [[Koth]] told Elspeth to leave, using his power to sink her into the ground so that she would have only one option left to her. He erected a shield to protect her from the blast, but the Phyrexian forces finally broke through, and a <c>Phyrexian Obliterator</c> grievously injured the trapped knight before she could leave. In a half lucid state, she planeswalked away, incapacitated, and delirious from her near-fatal wounds.\n\n===Theros===\n[[File:Elspeth Art key.jpg|left|thumb|285x285px|[[Heliod]] orders Elspeth to kill [[Polukranos]].]]\nShe awoke on [[Theros (plane)|Theros]], the world to which she had first planeswalked fifteen years earlier.<ref name=\"On cards\">{{DailyRef|feature/theros-beyond-death-story-cards-2019-12-16|The Theros Beyond Death Story on Cards|[[Wizards of the Coast]]|December 16, 2019}}</ref> She had been drawn to the plane for the divine nature of the gods, in hopes they would provide stability. In the past, she had witnessed a battle between [[Heliod]] and [[Purphoros]] and had found the Sword of Chaos when it was knocked to the mortal world from Purphoros's hand. It was during this brief period that she met [[Daxos]] and earned the attention of Heliod. Overwhelmed by the presence of the god, she fled, taking the sword as she went.\n\nAfter Mirrodin, Elspeth landed at a temple of Pharika's worshipers and wrote a letter to Ajani, rolled it up in a bottle, and then dumped it in the bogs: a custom for the prayers of Pharika's worshipers. Once she regained her strength, Elspeth journeyed out, hoping to find a place in the world where she could learn of the gods and understand their abilities. This quest drew her to [[Akros]] where she joined a mercenary band to earn a place within the city. Unfortunately, her presence had not gone unnoticed, for the sword she bore had been lost for years. When she found Heliod in his temple, he tried to kill her but Elspeth rebuffed him with her magic, stunning the supposed King of the Gods. Threatened by her power and the sword, he transformed the blade into a spear he dubbed ''[[Godsend]]'' and commanded her to make her way to his main temple in [[Meletis]].\n\nThe journey was not to be a peaceful one. Every god wished to possess the weapon and was all driven to frenzy, manipulated in secret by [[Xenagos]] to fear what the others might do should they claim the blade. The caravan that Elspeth traveled with was set upon repeatedly until at last the gods nearly destroyed much of Theros in their blind desire. [[Kruphix]] commanded them all to return to [[Nyx]] where they would be unable to harm the mortal world, but [[Nylea]] was the only one aware of the threat looming upon Meletis even as he did so. Elspeth encountered [[Polukranos]], a massive hydra that had slain countless warriors. Elspeth engaged the hydra with the help of Daxos and succeeded where so many had failed, slaying it. This feat of heroism secured her place at the temple of Heliod in Meletis as the god's champion.\n\n===Journey into Nyx===\n[[File:Deicide.jpg|thumb|319x319px|Elspeth kills the god Xenagos in Nyx.]]\nMonths passed as she learned what the priests of Heliod had to teach, but she found she enjoyed the time spent with Daxos the most. They grew closer, but he seemed reluctant to answer her questions as she wanted him to. He pushed her away, using Heliod's dogma to keep her from learning too much. At last they had an argument that seemed to drive a wedge between them, but Daxos apologized and asked her to travel with him. Together, they rode to the place they had met.\n\nWhen they returned to Meletis, they found [[Anthousa]] waiting for Daxos, and stories of the Nyxborn attacking humanity. The only option they could find was to consult the ageless sphinx known as [[Medomai]]. He had nothing but dire predictions for the pair and a vision of Akros under siege. What the pair did not understand was that the vision was not of the future. Along with Anthousa, they rode hard to defend Akros. They found the unexpected: the minotaurs had constructed a giant wall to keep reinforcements out. As they spoke of what they could do, Queen [[Cymede]] suddenly barged in, saying that they had captured a satyr that demanded to speak to Elspeth.\n\nShe was led to the dungeons where she found Xenagos chained. He told her that he knew how they could destroy the army without ever battling, and she listened to him tell his plan. They would raise the river that ran through Akros and sweep the army away, but for it to succeed Cymede and Daxos would have to raise the river while the invaders were distracted. When King Anax heard this plan, he knew the perfect distraction and challenged the horde's leader to a duel, naming Elspeth as his second. The plan worked and Akros stood.[[File:Heliod kills Elspeth.jpg|thumb|312x312px|Heliod kills Elspeth.|alt=|left]]After leading the armies of Akros to victory, the king ordered a celebration that was held to honor her victory. Together, alone in their tent, Daxos and Elspeth finally realize their feelings for each other. But it was not to be. Xenagos appeared as they slept, thrilled with how well she followed his plan. He controlled her and brought back her darkest memory, trapped with the <c>Phyrexian Obliterator</c> looming over her. Elspeth struck out and killed it... only realizing too late that she had just killed Daxos.\n\nOutside the tent, the revel had been suborned by Xenagos. As she fled, Elspeth saw Xenagos ascend into Nyx. She was met with scorn by the citizens of the polis and fled for her life into the wilderness. Her world was thrown into chaos as even the god she had sought to understand turned against her. Heliod was wroth, believing she was implicit in Xenagos's plan, and sought to destroy her.\n\nCast out, she found an unexpected ally in the Leonin. With the help of [[Brimaz]], she reunited with her old friend Ajani. He was curious about what had befallen her, but she refused to speak of how badly she'd been hurt. Instead, she swore they would set things right and Ajani agreed to stay at her side. To do so, they would have to travel to the mysterious temple of [[Kruphix]] at the edge of the world. They traveled by river from the Nessian forest to the Siren's Shipyard, seeking the legendary mariner [[Callaphe]]. Standing amidst the shattered wreckage of ships, Ajani called up the legendary sunken ship known as the ''Monsoon'', and to their surprise, Callaphe appeared as soon as her ship had risen from the deep.\n\nShe agreed to take them to the edge of the world, but that turned out to be a lie. Upon reaching the sunken city of [[Arixmethes]], Callaphe revealed that her identity was a falsehood and that she was in truth the merfolk planeswalker [[Kiora]]. [[Thassa]] confronted them, intending to deal with the lying merfolk, but not before sending the pair on their way, wishing them luck. They arrived at the edge of the world, and the god [[Kruphix]] allowed them to pass to the gateway of Nyx, the shrine of Nykthos. To gain entry to Nyx, Elspeth had to undergo an ordeal sent from the gods. Ajani urged Elspeth to take Thassa's ordeal, but at the last moment she pulled away from him and instead gained entry from [[Erebos]].\n\nShe was suddenly elsewhere, back on Bant as she watched a husband she had never had depart their small cottage. She had lived with him for years, and she could not bear it as she realized it was false. It was only the start though, as she looked upon her son and daughter. The little girl, named Mina, urged her to drink from a golden goblet, strangely out of place, and she realized what it would mean to drink from that cup. Though it broke her heart, she smashed the cup and passed Erebos's ordeal.\n\nHaunted by the memories of the life she had never lived, the pair set to the task at hand. They confronted Xenagos and battled the god until at last Elspeth struck him down. As Xenagos's body fell back to Theros, Elspeth offered her life in trade for Daxos - a deal the god took gladly. Ajani insisted they could escape, the battle had taken its toll, and Nylea warned the pair that they must flee before Erebos or [[Heliod]] found them. They managed to reach Nykthos again before Heliod appeared and using her weapon fatally wounded Elspeth.\n\n[[File:Elspeth Returned.jpg|thumb|Elspeth in the Underworld.|alt=|317x317px]]\n\n===The Underworld===\nAjani took his dying friend back to Theros and prepared to fight the agents of Erebos who were coming to claim his friend, but Brimaz's warriors ambushed him, pulling him away for his own good as his friend died.\n\nAs her life ebbed, Elspeth prayed to the god that had killed her, asking for peace at last. However, on Theros, death is rarely the end of a traveler's journey. In [[the Underworld]] of Theros. Most ordinary humans would be doomed to dwell in the eternal gray realm or to surrender their identities and become the [[Returned]] - but Elspeth is no ordinary human. She noticed a young girl who was about to touch the veil, but then was shocked to see that the girl's face was a husk before the Returned dragged Elpseth underwater. She drowned until her spark reignited in a blinding light. Despite her tragic end, she still holds her reasons for upholding her honor close to her heart: her deep love for Theros, her companions, and the innocents that she has sworn to protect.<ref>{{DailyRef|feature/checking-planeswalkers-2015-2015-08-19|Checking in on the Planeswalkers (2015)|[[Mel Li]]|August 19, 2015}}</ref>\n===Beyond death===\n[[File:Agonizing Remorse.jpg|left|thumb|251x251px|[[Ashiok]] explores Elspeth's remorse and [[nightmare]]<nowiki/>s in the [[The Underworld|Underworld]].<nowiki/>]]Something disturbed Elspeth's rest in [[Ilysia]].<ref name=\"On cards\"/> The planeswalker [[Ashiok]] had begun spreading their unique brand of [[nightmare]]s throughout Theros, and not even the Underworld was safe from such dark power. Each night in her dreams, Elspeth relived her traumatic past, and her twisted memories were all too delicious for Ashiok to ignore. During such a nightmare, Elspeth pulled Heliod's spear, [[Khrusor]], from her dream which in real life became [[Shadowspear]].<ref>{{DailyRef|feature/theros-beyond-death-story-summary-2020-01-10|''Theros Beyond Death'' Story Summary|[[Wizards of the Coast]]|January 10, 2020}}</ref> \n\nElspeth eventually tried to escape from the Underworld, gathering allies and followers on her path for vengeance against Heliod. Her escape attempt brought on the wrath of [[Klothys]], the God of Destiny. Klothys sent the [[Nyxborn]] [[Calix]] to bring Elspeth back, but she would always defeat him. In return, Calix would learn more and more about Elspeth with every fight, improving at every step. \n\nElspeth claimed that Shadowspear was the true Khrusor and that Heliod's spear was a fake. Due to the nature of belief in Theros, when mortals started to acknowledge Shadowspear as the true Khrusor, Heliod's spear weakened to the point of shattering when clashing against Elspeth's weapon. The God of the Sun was forced to yield and Erebos imprisoned him in the Underworld forever. By defeating his most hated enemy, Elspeth won the God of the Dead's eternal gratitude and permission to return to the world of the living. After meeting with Daxos one last time, Elspeth planeswalked away. Calix, whose spark had ignited in the meantime, followed her.\n\n===Streets of New Capenna===\n[[File:Elspeth Resplendent.jpg|thumb|At [[Ajani Goldmane|Ajani]]'s request, she goes to [[New Capenna]] to investigate ways to defeat the [[Phyrexian]]s.|alt=|317x317px]]\nElspeth wanted peace. For most of her life, she has been haunted by memories of being imprisoned by Phyrexians during her childhood. Though she escaped when her Planeswalker spark ignited, she never forgot her captors; the memory of them keeps her awake at night.

The leonin told Elspeth the name of her home plane, which contains the metropolis of [[New Capenna]], and had been invaded by Phyrexians but somehow managed to defeat them. Elspeth decided to go to New Capenna, hoping to discover the way the denizens of the plane defeated the Phyrexian invaders.

Hoping to learn more about the Phyrexian invaders from the Maestros' art collection, Elspeth accepted his offer.<ref name=\"Laundry\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/episode-2-dirty-laundry-2022-03-29|Episode 2: Dirty Laundry|[[Elise Kova]]|March 29, 2022}}</ref>\n\nElspeth started working for the Maestros while investigating their museum. She then met [[Xander]], the leader of the family who gave Elspeth her first taste of [[Halo]] and a mission to deliver something to Park Heights. There, she would meet [[Vivien Reid]].<ref name=\"Side Freedom\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/side-freedom-2022-03-30|The Side of Freedom|[[Elise Kova]]|March 30, 2022}}</ref> After the mission, Xander tasked Elspeth to infiltrate the [[Cabaretti]] to find out if they truly can produce unlimited Halo.

Now wielding [[Luxior]], a narrow sword infused with [[Halo]], she was able to strike a deadly blow against Nixilis, forcing him to planeswalk away to safety.<ref name=\"Hymn\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/episode-5-hymn-angels-2022-04-05|Episode 5: Hymn of the Angels|[[Elise Kova]]|April 5, 2022}}</ref>\n\nAfter the turmoil, Elspeth gained entry to [[Xander]]'s Archives, where she learned of the plane's history and its battle with the [[Phyrexian]] threat. She and Vivien planeswalked to [[Dominaria (plane)|Dominaria]] to inform [[the Gatewatch]] of their findings.<ref name=\"Hymn\"/>\n\n===Fighting the Phyrexians===\n\nElspeth was recruited by the [[Gatewatch]] to join the fight against the Phyrexians.

Abandoning the group, he set out to find her. Because he carried the [[Sylex]], the complete group set out after him.\n\nFinding Vraska in [[Mephidross#The Dross Pist|Sheoldred's Coliseum]], they found she was heavily wounded and already infected with [[Phyresis]]. Too late to save her, Jace chose to stay behind with her and relive their happy moments on Ravnica in his mind. Lingering too long, Vraska succumbed to the Phyrexian influence and infected Jace in turn. The others tried to escape but were quickly overwhelmed by the black Phyrexians. Nahiri, who was also infected, decided to sacrifice herself for the greater good. With a mighty magical blast, she exploded the Coliseum and dropped it with all remaining planeswalkers on the [[Fair Basilica]]. Nearer to their goal, the infected Jace rejoined them and volunteered to carry the [[Sylex]] to the [[Seedcore]].<ref name=\"Losses\"/>\n\nThrough the Basilica and the Seedcore, the team encountered the disassembled Karn, who lamented the desperate state of the plan and the sacrifices both made and looming. The last significant resistance in the Seedcore was the pair of [[Tibalt]] and Ajani, to which Tyvar and Elspeth engaged respectively.<ref name=\"Impossible\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/assault-on-new-phyrexia-or-episode-4-impossible-odds|Assault on New Phyrexia - Episode 4: Impossible Odds|[[Seanan McGuire]]|January 16, 2023}}</ref> Tibalt's traumatic magic looked to have hobbled Elspeth, but her deep instincts kept her on guard, and once Tyvar disabled Tibalt she knocked Ajani unconscious and ran further into the Seedcore. Instinctively, she realized both how deep the Realmbreaker reached and the state of the Sylex, so she stabbed Jace and took hold of the Sylex. Both Elspeth and Sylex disappeared without a trace.<ref name=\"Inevitable\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/assault-on-new-phyrexia-or-episode-5-inevitable-resolutions|Assault on New Phyrexia - Episode 5: Inevitable Resolution|[[Seanan McGuire]]|January 16, 2023}}</ref>\n\n===Ascension===\n[[Image:To_find_out_is_divine.jpg|right|thumb|251x251px|A newly ascended Elspeth wounding Elesh Norn]]\nIn the [[Blind Eternities]], Elspeth found consciousness. She saw a vision of her mother, who showed her that [[New Phyrexia's Invasion of the Multiverse|New Phyrexia was ravaging the Multiverse]]. She saw Capenna, where [[Atraxa]] was destroying the statues of angels. Next, guided by a vision of Daxos, she saw Theros, where Ajani was corrupting the faith. Finally, she was guided by a disembodied voice to New Phyrexia, where [[Chandra Nalaar|Chandra]], [[Wrenn]] and Koth were about to be ''compleated'' by [[Jin-Gitaxias]]. The voice revealed itself to belong to [[Serra]] and bestowed the power of an archangel onto Elspeth, then faded away, leaving her to intervene.<ref name=\"Last to Leave\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/episode-6-the-last-to-leave|''March of the Machine'' - Episode Six: The Last to Leave|[[K.

The captured planeswalkers used this advantage to press back toward [[Realmbreaker]] and advance Wrenn's plan. Elspeth noticed that Elesh Norn was focusing exclusively on her, and called her out for having individual desires, a violation of her dogma. Elspeth acknowledged that Phyrexia's ideals of unity had merit, but declared that its crusade of conquest was only conducted for Norn's selfish wishes, not for Phyrexia's. Norn's increasing rage only confirmed Elspeth's words. After fighting the Grand Praetor to a stalemate, she then flew away to cover the planeswalkers' attack on Realmbreaker, as Norn impotently screamed after her to finish their duel.<ref name=\"Divine\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/episode-7-divine-intervention|''March of the Machine'' - Episode 7: Divine Intervention|[[K.

Though she was nearly overwhelmed defending the Mirran barricade, the [[Zhalfir]]in army summoned by Wrenn helped ease her burden.<ref name=\":0\" /> When the Mirrans and Zhalfirins evacuated from New Phyrexia through Wrenn's fading portal to Zhalfir, Elspeth knocked out Nissa with the hilt of her sword, allowing Chandra to carry her to safety.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/episode-9-the-old-sins-of-new-phyrexia|''March of the Machine'' - Episode 9: The Old Sins of New Phyrexia|[[K.

Though Koth was somewhat put off by her seemingly inhuman demeanor, he was still comforted by her assurance that [[Melira]], who was mortally wounded and planning to heal Ajani and Nissa as her last act, would die valorously on her terms. She embraced her friend, assuring him that if he ever needed her help, all he had to do was pray. Elspeth then brought Koth to Melira's medical tent so that he could see her off in her last moments before flying away, illuminated by the five suns of Mirrodin now orbiting Zhalfir.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/episode-10-the-rhythms-of-life|2=''March of the Machine'' - Episode 10: The Rhythms of Life|3=[[K.

Soon, the Jeskai monastery was attacked by dragons and Elspeth helped Narset defeat them before leaving. [[Taigam]] believed her presence had attracted the dragons.\n\nLater, Narset and Elspeth traveled to the Crucible of the Spirit Dragon.<ref name=\"Past Devours\"/> They were met by [[Sarkhan Vol]], who was elated that dragonstorms were appearing across the Multiverse. Sarkhan engaged Elspeth in battle but his desparked form was no match for the archangel and he was quickly defeated.\n\nAfter having heard a mysterious voice in the crucible urging them to find \"the temple in the heart of storms\", Narset and Elspeth traveled the Abzan [[Stormplains]]. While at the court of [[khan]] [[Felothar]], they were warned by [[Ajani Goldmane]] that [[Sarkhan Vol]] had taken the form of an enormous dragon and had taken control of Tarkir's wild dragons.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/tarkir-dragonstorm-episode-4-heart-of-fire|Tarkir: Dragonstorm - Episode 4: Heart of Fire|[[Cassandra Khaw]]|March 10, 2025}}</ref>\n\nElspeth and Narset traveled to the heart of the storm to find an ancient temple that housed a ragged [[Omenpath]] leading to [[Meditation Realm]]. There they encountered two invisible forces. One that wished to encourage the dragonstorms and one that desired to halt them. While investigating, they happened on [[Jace Beleren]] and the creature [[Loot]] who were somehow involved with what was happening with the dragonstorms.<ref name=\"Recursion\"/>\n\nAt first, the Realm looked different for each of them, as their thoughts trapped them in a shifting space. They saw no logic, no actual roads, and feared they would be trapped forever.<ref name=\"Wretched\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/tarkir-dragonstorm-episode-6-how-wretched-love|Tarkir: Dragonstorm - Episode 6: How Wretched Love|[[Cassandra Khaw]]|March 14, 2025}}</ref> However, Narset realized that the plane was adapting to their thoughts and used a meditative technique to empty her mind, allowing the plane to assume its true form. To their shock, they were met by the two elder dragons that had been sealed away here in eternal lockdown. While [[Ugin]] berated Jace for breaking their agreement and warned them to get away, the nameless dragon that had been [[Nicol Bolas]] saw a chance to gain information and regain power. However, they were interrupted by Jace stealing the [[Spirit-Gem]] from Ugin and beginning to cast his [[Jace Beleren's attempt to fix the Multiverse|spell to recreate the Multiverse]]. Elspeth tried to prevent him from casting the spell, but he evaded her with illusionary duplicates. However, Jace ran out of mana and the spell collapsed. As it failed, it revealed a void that poured toward them, unmaking reality — Jace included.<ref name=\"Wretched\" /> The others desperately tried to escape.\n\nEmerging in the temple on the Stormplains, Elspeth came upon Sarkhan and his horde of wild dragons, who had approached the temple with intent to destroy it. Vraska disappeared with Loot, leaving only Narset and Elspeth to fight the dragons, but they were bolstered by the arrival of Ajani, Felothar, and the forces of the Abzan. They were able to hold Sarkhan off, but they were greatly outnumbered by the wild dragons, who dealt the Abzan many casualties. Narset realized that Sarkhan had cast a corrupted version of the [[Stormnexus Ritual]], and they would level the plane at his command unless he was stopped. As they prepared a desperate charge to disable him, however, Ugin appeared and immediately defeated Sarkhan with his [[ghostfire]]. Although they had won, it was at a terrible cost: Ugin was only able to appear because, in the aftermath of Jace's spell, Bolas had escaped.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/tarkir-dragonstorm-episode-7-return|Tarkir: Dragonstorm - Episode 7: Return|[[Cassandra Khaw]]|March 17, 2025}}</ref>\n\n==Artifacts acquired== \n*[[Godsend]] {{-}} a holy swordspear crafted by [[Purphoros]]\n*A mask of the [[Returned]] {{-}} A deathmask forged for her in [[the Underworld]], using the two jewels of Godsend.\n*<c>Shadowspear</c> {{-}} Heliod's spear, Khrusor, was pulled from a nightmare and turned into a real-life weapon.\n*{{card|Luxior, Giada's Gift|title=Luxior}} {{-}} A [[Halo]]-infused sword.

He was usually dressed in black and wore his spells satchel at his belt. In Norreen's opinion, Garth resembled a \"scarecrow\". His only arresting features were his eyes, turquoise blue. The lost eye, in fact, grew back thanks to his [[Igniting|ascension]], leaving a white scar-star around it.\n\n==History==\nHe was born as Galin, son of [[Cullinarn]], the master of the green-blue [[House of Oor-tael]]. The house was destroyed by [[Kuthuman]], the [[Grand Master of the Arena]] of [[Estark]], who was on a quest to become a [[Planeswalker (lore)|planeswalker]]. Garth was five years old at the time of the event that would be known as the [[Night of Fire]], and [[Zarel]], the servant of Kuthuman, gouged his left eye out to torment his father. Garth ran back into the burning House and Zarel believed he was dead.\n\nAfter twenty years in exile, he returned to Estark under the false name of Garth and manipulated the remaining houses and the new Grand Master, Zarel, so that he could win the tournament and meet Kuthuman, in what would be then known as the [[Time of Troubles]]. During his fights in the [[Arena (location)|Arena]] he became known to the mob as Garth One-eye. Garth was successful in defeating Kuthuman, and even managed to somehow use a spell to [[Igniting|steal the ability to walk the planes]].<ref name=\"Returning\">{{DailyRef|feature/returning-legends-modern-horizons-2-2021-06-10|The Returning Legends of ''Modern Horizons 2''|[[Ethan Fleischer]]|June 10, 2021}}</ref>  Later, he willingly gave up planeswalking to live with the [[Benalish]] woman known at the time as [[Norreen]], whom he had met during his adventure.<ref name=\"arena\">[[William R. Forstchen]] (1994). [[Arena (novel)|Magic: The Gathering - Arena]].

However, Garth found leaving behind his powers much harder than he had thought and started journeying between the planes again. It was during one of his absences that Norreen and Hammen were kidnapped and brought to [[Benalia]].<ref name=\"shattered\"/>\n\nAfter the death of [[List of secondary characters/Dominaria|Sabriam]] and the rescue of Norreen and Hammen, Garth started a fight with [[Gull]] and [[Greensleeves]], thinking they had been the kidnappers. However, Greensleeves quickly brought the wizard to his senses. When confronted by Norreen on his negligence for family duty, Garth admitted the wrongness of his ways, giving up his spells satchel to Greensleeves and promising he would never abandon his family anymore. He then offered his knowledge of Dominaria, gathered during his wanderings, in order to bring the people from Greensleeves army to their homelands. Then he and his family returned to their vineyard, offering their help if Greensleeves requested it.<ref name=\"shattered\">[[Clayton Emery]] (1994). [[Shattered Chains|Magic: The Gathering - Shattered Chains]]. Harper Prism.</ref>\n\n==On Garth's spark==\nGarth appeared only in [[prerevisionist]] books, in which there was no mention of a [[planeswalker's spark]]: any mage could break the plane's veil with the right spells and sufficient [[mana]] and travel across the planes. To make the prerevisionist books fit [[Revisionist]] Continuity, many people believe that wizards who became planeswalkers by spells actually possessed sparks that were flared by the spells they cast, but didn't know of these sparks or their role in becoming planeswalkers. However, Garth might be an exception to this theory. The novel [[Arena (novel)|''Arena'']] states that the spell researched by [[Kirlen]] could grant the planeswalking powers to anyone casting it. It's not likely though, that Kirlen created a real spark with her spell because even planeswalkers don't understand its nature fully. The explanation of this might be that the spell just simulated powers of spark to some extent. \n\nIn 2021, it was stated in a retcon that Garth's planeswalker spark [[igniting|ignited]] at the moment he won vengeance against the killer of his kin.<ref name=\"Returning\"/>\n\n==On Garth's mana==\nGarth, despite being born to a family and guild of blue-green casters, demonstrated the use of all 5 [[color]]s of [[mana]].<ref name=\"MH2 Card Preview\"/>\n* [[Green]] mana: summoned a war [[mammoth]], called <c>Llanowar Elves</c>, cast <c>Fog</c>, Ironroot [[Treefolk]], <c>Wall of Wood</c>, <c>Wall of Brambles</c>, <c>Giant Growth</c>, <c>Giant Spider</c>, <c>Craw Wurm</c>.

The upper half of her body is similar to a woman, with gray skin, long black hair, eyes with white pupils, and two arms with claw hands. The lower half of her body is made up of legs that end in tentacles (akin to octopuses) with gray and purple suckers.\n\nShe is a powerful mage with a vast knowledge of magic. Her magical expertise is in corrupting, enslaving, and manipulating creatures. Dihada had access to [[red]], [[black]], [[white]], and [[blue]] [[mana]].\n\n==History==\nGeyadrone Dihada is an incredibly ancient [[demon]]ic [[Planeswalker (lore)|planeswalker]]. Her schemes span millennia, and her lust for power and dominance knows no limits. She is compelled to bring the most powerful beings under her control. Sometimes, as with the [[Elder Dragon]]s [[Chromium]] and [[Piru]], she finds the champions she seeks and binds them with powerful spells. Sometimes, she finds [[creature]]s with great potential and molds them, corrupts them, to suit her needs. So, it was with the [[Maro-Sorcerer]] [[Sol'Kanar]] and the planeswalker [[Dakkon]] whom she corrupted into monsters so that they might better serve her.<ref name=\"MH2\" />\n\n===Dihada's schemes===\n[[File:Dihada absorbing Piru's energy .png|left|thumb|272x272px|After absorbing [[Piru]]'s energy Dihada temporarily loses control over her form and ends up looking more monstrous.]]When first seen she instructed [[Dakkon]] in [[forging the Blackblade]] for her in return for the power of a planeswalker. She returned after ten years and triggered his planeswalker's [[spark]], but then she used the [[Blackblade]] to absorb his shadow and his soul into the blade. Dakkon was left wandering the planes, wondering why Dihada would grant him so much power, only to make him her enemy.\n\nLater, she corrupted the nature spirit of [[Khone]], [[Sol'Kanar]], gave him the Black Blade, and set about conquering [[Corondor]]. Sol'Kanar created her [[Unholy Citadel]] from the remains of slain enemies, which crept across the land on giant legs of bone. \n[[File:GeyadroneDihada.jpg|thumb|302x302px|Dihada after the [[Great Mending|Great Mending.]]]]\nMany years later, she tricked a boy named for the kingdom of [[Carth (location)|Carth]] into [[summoning]] Dakkon and bound the planeswalker to himself. This effectively robbed Dakkon of his planeswalking ability and allowed Dihada to mark him as her champion. The boy had Dakkon attack her, but she summoned the [[Elder Dragons]] [[Piru]] and [[Rhuell]] to fight him. Dakkon killed Piru in a blast so powerful that it ripped the group apart and created the [[Dueling Chasm of Golthonor]]. This allowed Dihada to absorb the dragon's life force and power. Dakkon then turned on her, but she managed to stall him just long enough to place her mark on him. Because of their intensity, the battles between them would become known as the [[Blackblade–Dihada War]], even though they lasted only a few days. \n\nAfterward, she left [[Dominaria (plane)|Dominaria]] and wasn't seen until the [[Planeswalkers' War]] on Corondor, many millennia later. It's unknown what happened during that war, but another participant was [[Jared Carthalion]], a descendant of Carth, the boy who had summoned Dakkon. \n\nDihada left Dominaria at the close of the Planeswalker War, a few years before the [[Phyrexian Invasion]]. The people of Dominaria believed that she still lived (though in diminished form), for legend said that Sol'Kanar would be restored to his original form upon her death and that he still ruled as a [[demon]] king in Corondor to this day.<ref name=\"MH2\">{{DailyRef|feature/returning-legends-modern-horizons-2-2021-06-10|The Returning Legends of ''Modern Horizons 2''|[[Ethan Fleischer]]|June 10, 2021}}</ref>\n\n===Dominaria United===\nDihada made a reappearance during the second Phyrexian Invasion at the [[Tolarian Academy]] at [[Lat-Nam]].<ref name=\"Ulf\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/education-ulf-2022-08-15|The Education of Ulf|[[Brian Evenson]]|August 15, 2022}}</ref><ref name=\"DMU Legends\">{{DailyRef|feature/legends-youll-find-dominaria-united-2022-09-01|The Legends You'll Find in Dominaria United|[[Roy Graham]]|September 1, 2022}}</ref> At some point, she disposed of the Academy's archmage and took his place.

Fiercely loyal, unyielding, just, and charismatic, Gideon Jura wouldn't hesitate to enter combat to defend the innocent. He was a powerful warrior-mage with the ability to make himself invulnerable. His distinctive weapon, the sural, consisted of four whip-like blades anchored to the exterior of his armguard. A man of the people, he took pride in leading his comrades towards the common good.\n\nGideon believed that those with power should protect the weak, and took this belief personally, using his invulnerability to protect any in need. He was one to never lose faith in those he called friends, even when all others had, a belief he took to his death, giving his invulnerability to Liliana (although everyone else wished her dead), saving her from her fate at the cost of his own life.\n\nGideon Jura was centered in [[white]] [[mana]], though he had red tendencies and aligned himself with the [[Boros Legion]].<ref>{{EzTumblr|https://dougbeyermtg.tumblr.com/post/105497037894/is-chandra-a-red-character-with-white-tendencies|title=Is Gideon a white character with red tendencies?|December 17, 2014}}</ref> As he planeswalked, he disappeared in a burst of light, a golden storm.\n\n==History==\n===Adolescence===\nBorn in a slum of [[Akros]] on [[Theros (plane)|Theros]], Gideon never knew his father, as he had left sometime before Gideon was born. He lived with his mother until her death while he was still a young man. With no better options, Gideon joined a gang, of which he soon became the de facto leader by age thirteen. With high ideals, he led the other boys to start stealing from the mansions of the rich, taking only what they needed to survive and giving the rest away to the poor.\n[[File:Magic Origins key art.jpg|thumb|Magic Origins key art]]\nAlas, he was caught and Gideon found himself in prison, one poorly suited to keeping him. With that in mind, the local constabulary found a man able to deal with Gideon. This man took him from prison intending to rehabilitate Gideon by teaching him Hieromancy, the magic of order. After a few failed escape attempts on Gideon's part, he eventually settled in, finding the magic fascinating and enjoying the feeling of power he was cultivating. His teacher recognized something within him though and began teaching Gideon of planeswalkers, one of whom had been his teacher, and the man that had given him his sural. He also instilled in Gideon a warning against pyromancy, the form of magic that had killed his former master. Gideon's [[spark]] ignited when he killed a much stronger opponent. The impossibility of his survival seemed so overwhelming that as Gideon tried to reconcile what he found, he achieved momentary enlightenment, a perfect perception of the entire multiverse, and slipped into the [[Blind Eternities]]. When he arrived in [[Bant|another world]] his sense of clarity quickly faded, and he returned to tell his teacher what had happened. His teacher revealed that he had been expecting it, having only ever seen one hieromancer as powerful as Gideon, the man who had taught him. He passed the sural onto Gideon that day, and Gideon left to try and find enlightenment once more.\n\n====Revised Origin====\n[[File:Gideon spark.jpg|thumb|272x272px|The moment that Kytheon's spark ignites from the death of his Irregulars due to his arrogance.|alt=|left]]\nKytheon toiled for four years in prison. When the [[Theros (plane)#Akros|Kolophon]] came under attack by [[harpies]] and [[cyclops]]es, Gideon's teacher, the prison warden [[Hixus]], freed the prisoners that were willing to defend the keep.<ref>{{WebRef|url=https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/uncharted-realms/gideons-origin-kytheon-iora-akros-2015-07-01|title=Gideon’s Origin: Kytheon Iora of Akros|author=[[Ari Levitch]]|date=July 1, 2015|work=[[magicthegathering.com]]|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20201021214711/https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/uncharted-realms/gideons-origin-kytheon-iora-akros-2015-07-01|archivedate=2020-10-21}}</ref> Kytheon saved the day, leading his irregulars and using his new-found hieromancy. Afterward, he was championed by the [[God]] [[Heliod]] to defeat an even greater menace, the [[titan]] of [[Erebos]] (who was also another god). Using Heliod's spear and with the help of his troops, Kytheon accomplished this. Impelled by his hubris, he then threw the spear at Erebos himself. Erebos easily changed the course of the spear, killing all the irregulars. Shocked and shamed by their deaths at his hand, Kytheon then made his first planeswalk to Bant. There he became known as Gideon.\n\n===The Purifying Fire===\nAs described in the novel, [[The Purifying Fire]], Gideon heard legends in his travels referencing a large naturally occurring fountain of white mana that took the shape of fire on the plane of [[Regatha]]. It was called the [[Purifying Fire]] by the [[Order of Heliud]], the group that watched over the flame. With interest, Gideon pursued this legend hoping to study it, and was initially denied his request by the head of the Regathan Order, Walbert. Walbert finally acquiesced if Gideon would do him a favor and tasked Gideon with recovering the planeswalker known as [[Chandra Nalaar]] when she left [[Keral Keep]].<ref name=TPF> ''[[The Purifying Fire]]''</ref>\n\nGideon followed Chandra to Kephalai where he quickly found her, due to her cataclysmic theft of the [[Dragon Scroll]]. This theft led to the destruction of the [[Sanctum of Stars]] and Gideon tracked Chandra down and attempted to assist her. Unfortunately, he wasn't the only being to have found her and in an attempt to save innocent lives, he incapacitated Chandra. Eventually, he returned the scroll, having kept it in hopes that Chandra would not be executed until it was found, but with her escape, he found no reason to keep it.<ref name=TPF> ''[[The Purifying Fire]]''</ref>\n\nGideon once again tracked Chandra, landing on the plane of [[Diraden]] in Chandra's footsteps, much to the pyromancer's immense disbelief and fury. He quickly calmed her and suggested that they would accomplish more to escape the plane, which was dominated by black mana and endless night ruled by a Vampire prince if they would work together. Chandra's last ally, a goblin named Jurl, chose that moment to attack them, and Gideon quickly subdued the being. With Jurl as their guide, Gideon and Chandra found their way to a village to speak with their wise woman, the menarch Falia. Falia appeared to be a child, but through the use of Blood Magic, had gained her wisdom from her mother, as well as slowed her aging considerably. Falia was instantly smitten by Gideon's good looks and secretly plotted to separate Chandra from her accomplice. She sent Gideon on a hunting expedition and summoned the Fog Riders to abduct Chandra. Gideon showed up at an opportune moment and slew one of the Fog Riders before they were both incapacitated.<ref name=TPF> ''[[The Purifying Fire]]''</ref>\n\nWhile [[List of secondary characters#Diraden|Prince Velrav]] treated Chandra to his bed chambers, Gideon was handled with more ostentation for his part in the death of the Fog Rider. Gideon was tied to stakes in the courtyard with the understanding that any who should wish it were encouraged to feed on him. When Chandra awoke, she parlayed with Velrav to treat Gideon with more mercy, which resulted in the planeswalker being moved into the dungeons below. Unfortunately, as part of the price paid to have Gideon moved, Chandra had told Velrav of planeswalkers, and Velrav believed he could harness Gideon's essence to become a planeswalker himself. During the ritual that was to attempt this though, Chandra beheaded the prince, and with his death, the spell preventing them from planeswalking was lifted.<ref name=TPF> ''[[The Purifying Fire]]''</ref>\n\nThe pair returned to Regatha and sought the help of Chandra's woodland friend [[List of secondary characters#Regatha|Samir Mia Kaulda]]. To Chandra's shock, Samir revealed that he had already met Gideon at the headquarters of the Order. Feeling betrayed, she left him to fend for himself and stormed back to Keral Keep. The Order had laid siege to the Keep though, with the simple ultimatum to hand over Chandra. When Chandra surrendered, she only requested that Gideon escort her to Walbert. When the walkers reached Walbert, he revealed that he planned to offer Chandra to the Purifying Fire, hoping she would be cleansed and left powerless as an example to any who would oppose him. Gideon felt immense guilt, not having known of Walbert's intentions, and sought some way to help Chandra escape her fate. Finally, he found passages stating that if a person went into the fire with no regrets, that they may survive unharmed. Chandra confessed to Gideon of the accidental part she played in the death of her village and how it had haunted her ever since.<ref name=TPF> ''[[The Purifying Fire]]''</ref>\n\nThe Fire spared Chandra and left her intact, and with great relish, she destroyed Walbert and his guards, cracking the foundations of the Fire's cavern and the temple above with the power of her fire magic. Gideon was the first to venture forth into the ruin and found Chandra passed out. He was aghast at what she had done but swore he would cover for her if she left and never returned. Chandra revealed then that the soldiers that had killed her parents had the same ideals as the Order of Heliud, and it was in his best interest to consider his allegiances closely, stating that anyone who exemplified the Order's ideals was to be her enemy, even Gideon.<ref name=TPF> ''[[The Purifying Fire]]''</ref>\n\nGideon simply responded that they would meet again, and she vanished from Regatha.<ref name=TPF> ''[[The Purifying Fire]]''</ref>\n\n===The Battle of Fort Keff===\n[[File:Gideon Zendikar.jpg|left|thumb|Gideon's <c>Near Death Experience</c> against the Eldrazi|305x305px]]\nDespite the way the pair parted, Gideon soon began to regret the feelings that they had been left with. With some anxiety, Gideon set his sights on seeking the tempestuous world of [[Zendikar (plane)|Zendikar]].<ref>{{WebRef|url=https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/savor-flavor/battle-fort-keff-2010-03-31|title=The Battle of Fort Keff|author=[[Jenna Helland]]|date=March 31, 2010|work=[[magicthegathering.com]]|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112015546/https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/savor-flavor/battle-fort-keff-2010-03-31|archivedate=2020-11-12}}</ref> Gideon tracked Chandra through the continent of Akoum, only to find her trail going cold in the mountains near the [[Eye of Ugin]]. Weary to his bones, he found the nearest settlement, [[Fort Keff]], hoping to find some well-earned rest for himself. Around the fire, Gideon heard tales, strange and disturbing tales, from an adventurer named Tafre. He warned that the land had been acting odd, becoming far more violent than it ever had been before. With nightmarish tales still swimming in his head, Gideon went to sleep to dream of Chandra surrounded by white flames.\n\nHis rest wasn't to last though, as a primal scream tore his sleep from him. A [[surrakar]] had wandered too close to the fort, and the adventurers dealt with it harshly. While it lay injured, Gideon went to it. The beast warned him of its [[Eldrazi|gods]] who came from beyond the world, from the void with no color, who would devour all the life in their path. Among the assembled soldiers, only Gideon knew the true horrible scope of what the reptilian meant. All the next day, refugees poured in with tales of demon insects. The tales were but the heralds of the terror to come, as the brood swarmed the fort later that day. Gideon fought bravely amongst the soldiers of Fort Keff and he alone turned the tide against the brood. A cry of celebration went up, until [[Emrakul]] darkened the skies. Gideon told all the beings of the fort to flee, to follow the surrakar to the underground rivers.\n[[File:Battle for Zendikar key art.jpg|thumb|Battle for Zendikar key art]]\nLeft alone, Gideon simply stared at the titan before him, and desperately, he tried to think of some way to fight the creature before him. Only one solution came to him, and Gideon left to seek the assistance of a group of planeswalkers he had heard rumors about on the plane of [[Ravnica]] (presumably the [[Infinite Consortium]]).\n\n===Ravnica===\nUpon arrival, his immediate efforts came to no fruition. Whatever fate befell the group he was searching for remained a mystery, but as he traveled, he became aware of an overwhelming tension between the guilds. Paranoia and hostilities were rising with the [[guildless]] caught between the political juggernauts. Though Zendikar was in desperate straits, if the guilds went to war, the entire population of Zendikar would be only a fraction of the casualties on Ravnica. With little recourse, Gideon postponed his search, looking to the guilds for some way to curb the coming war.\n\nWhile battling a gang of [[Cult of Rakdos|Rakdos Cultists]], Gideon attracted the attention of the [[Boros Legion]]. He was approached by [[Aurelia]], believing that he could be a potent weapon for the Legion, and offered him a battalion to lead, perhaps more if he joined them. Gideon felt the Boros had the greatest chance of enforcing some form of peace and accepted command of the soldiers, shirking her offer of membership.<ref>{{DailyRef|feature/greater-good-2013-02-06|The Greater Good|[[Adam Lee]]|February 06, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{DailyRef|feature/battle-ninth-2013-06-19|Battle for the Ninth|[[Adam Lee]]|June 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===The Battle for Zendikar ===\n[[File:Gideon Jura and Kiora.jpg|thumb|347x347px|Gideon leads the Zendikari defensive forces at Sea Gate.|alt=]]\nTrying to fight a battle on two fronts - Ravnica and Zendikar - at once, Gideon discovered that the [[hedron]]s of Zendikar had the power of the [[eldrazi]] [[spawn]] and that they were connected by [[leyline]]s.

There, they found out that [[Sea Gate]] had fallen. They arrived in time to rescue several survivors from Sea Gate and escort them to [[Sky Rock]], a safe zone. Having found out that [[Jori En]] - Gideon's merfolk friend - was trapped at Sea Gate, Gideon left to find her and brought her back to Jace hoping that together they might be able to link Zendikar's leylines with the hedrons to find a way to stop the Eldrazi again.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/slaughter-refuge-2015-08-19|Slaughter at the Refuge|[[James Wyatt]]|August 19, 2015 }}</ref> After Jace and Jori En figured out that they had to travel to the [[Eye of Ugin]] in [[Akoum]], Gideon stayed behind to organize the refugees.

Gideon paid Noyan and his comrades a visit, seeking to recruit them as [[allies]] in helping to retake Sea Gate. After witnessing a demonstration of Noyan and the other roil-mages' power, Gideon requested that Noyan join them at Sky Rock. Noyan, who had up until this point thought Gideon an idiot, agreed, only to realize soon after that Gideon had used his hubris against him as manipulation to get him to offer his help.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/shaping-army-2015-10-21|Shaping an Army|[[Ken Troop]]|October 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Kiora]], a Planeswalker native to Zendikar, brought her army of [[merfolk]] and colossal sea [[monsters]] to the fight. Gideon's army began an attack on the Eldrazi-controlled Sea Gate, joined soon thereafter by [[Nissa]]. The Eldrazi were driven from the city, and Sea Gate's defensive ramparts were rebuilt and fortified. The soldiers of Zendikar celebrated a hard-won victory. Then, [[Jori En]] arrived with the news that [[Ulamog]] was approaching ....<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/liberation-sea-gate-2015-10-28|The Liberation of Sea Gate|[[James Wyatt]]|October 28, 2015}}</ref> The Planeswalkers enacted a bold new plan. While Gideon's troops and Kiora's forces held the city against this fresh assault, Nissa called on the [[elemental]] power of the earth to raise sunken hedrons from the ground and move them into a ring around the Eldrazi titan. Jace activated the hedrons' magic, and Ulamog was trapped! Then everything collapsed. [[Ob Nixilis]] appeared, having followed Nissa from [[Bala Ged]]. He summoned [[Kozilek]] and defeated Jace, Nissa, and Gideon. Nixilis even thought for a moment that he had killed Gideon.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/hedron-alignment-2015-11-18|Hedron Alignment|[[Kimberly J.

Thus they swore an oath to stand together and the [[Gatewatch]] was created.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/oath-gatewatch-2016-02-03|Oath of the Gatewatch|[[James Wyatt]]|February 3, 2016}}</ref> Seeing that he would be unable to keep his promise to Ugin to both neither harm the Eldrazi nor allowing them to escape from Zendikar, Jace decided to slay the Titans with the Gatewatch's and Kiora's help. After consulting with Nissa, he described the Ley Line pattern to her that would bind Kozilek and Ulamog to Zendikar, drawing the bulk of the Titans into the plane so that their energy could be dispersed into Zendikar, killing them in the process. To attract them, the remaining forces of Zendikar's defenders under Gideon's lead would pose as bait.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/brink-extinction-2016-02-10|Brink of Extinction|[[Kelly Digges]]|February 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhile the plan worked at first, with Gideon keeping the Eldrazi swarms away from the army, Kiora clearing out any other swarms, and Chandra supporting them, once the Eldrazi titans were anchored to Zendikar, their destructive essence threatened to assimilate Zendikar into themselves. Afraid, Kiora tried to persuade Nissa to release the Titans and allow them to flee, but Jace objected. Chandra offered to burn the Titans instead and after preventing Kiora from attacking Nissa, Jace agreed. The pyromancer then connected with the animist, allowing her to channel her pyromantic magic through Zendikar's Ley Lines directly into the titans. In one brilliant blaze of flame, Ulamog and Kozilek were incinerated and destroyed, leaving only ashes raining from Zendikar's sky.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/zendikars-last-stand-2016-02-17|Zendikar's Last Stand|[[Doug Beyer]]|February 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter the defeat of the Eldrazi titans, Gideon stayed a while on Zendikar to help rebuild its civilization.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/zendikar-resurgent-2016-02-24|Zendikar Resurgent|[[Ari Levitch]], [[Doug Beyer]], [[Kelly Digges]] and [[Kimberly J.

When the Gatewatch tried to use Ley Lines to bind Emrakul like the other titans, Gideon tried to protect his team members from the assaulting Eldrazi hordes but would have nearly been overwhelmed had it not been for the help of the necromancer Liliana Vess. Mistrusting her intentions at first, he later relented to Jace, since the telepath knew Liliana better than he did.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/battle-thraben-2016-07-20|Battle of Thraben|[[Nik Davidson]]|July 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhile trying to battle Emrakul, the Gatewatch fell under its corrupting influence. Gideon was trapped in a scene where he was confronted again by Erebos along with the other members of the Gatewatch. Erebos asked Gideon to tell him his true desire, or he would wipe out his new friends. Since none of Gideon's answers found the approval of the god, Gideon had to watch as his friends fell one by one. When he was freed from the trap by Jace, Gideon fought to keep the Eldrazi away while Jace, Nissa, and their new ally [[Tamiyo]] worked their spell to seal Emrakul into the [[Innistrad Moon|moon of Innistrad]]. After the battle was won, he approached Tamiyo, offering her a place in the Gatewatch. When the Soratami declined, Jace and Gideon talked and decided to offer Liliana the place instead.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/promised-end-2016-07-27|The Promised End|[[Ken Troop]]|July 27, 2016}}</ref> \n\n===Kaladesh===\n[[File:Gideon and Chandra.jpg|thumb|Chandra would blow up the construct with her fire magic, while Gideon would use his invulnerability to keep them both alive.|alt=]]\nGideon came to [[Kaladesh]] with the rest of the [[Gatewatch]] after learning of the presence of the rogue planeswalker [[Tezzeret]] there. Having been present during the finale of the [[Inventors' Fair]], the Gatewatch continued to lend aid to the [[Renegades]], moving from safe house to safe house. Gideon was skeptical about this, having stood on both sides of the law, and asked himself if they should have cooperated with [[Dovin Baan|Baan]] to shed light on the threat of Tezzeret from within. This caused friction with Chandra, who saw Tezzeret and the Consulate as the same, wanting to tear it all down. Gideon reminded her that the purpose of the Gatewatch was not traveling from plane to plane to impose their judgment on the world's inhabitants. Otherwise, they would be no better than tyrants. Likewise, he tried to restrain Liliana from killing Consulate soldiers without need. Liliana instead reprimanded him for underestimating the threat that Tezzeret posed.\n\nAfter days, the Gatewatch learned from [[Saheeli Rai]] that Tezzeret had sequestered himself into the Aether Spire, experimenting with the invention of Rashmi. Liliana volunteered to go together with [[Saheeli Rai|Saheeli]], while the Renegades planned a diversion by attacking the central Aether Hub of Ghirapur. Gideon would instead lead various attacks to spread Consulate forces thinly across the city.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/quiet-moments-2016-12-07|Quiet Moments|[[Michael Yichao]]|December 7, 2016}}</ref> Meeting again with Chandra, the two had an exchange over their previous meeting on [[Diraden]] and Chandra's actions on [[Kephalai]]. Gideon offered her physical comfort before [[Baral]] taunted Chandra to attack him. At the same time, the Aetherhub was under attack from Gearhulks and Gideon decided to protect it. He destroyed the Gearhulk by placing his indestructible body between the gears, causing it to collapse.<ref name=\"Burn\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/burn|Burn|[[Chris L'Etoile]]|January 4, 2017}}</ref> As the Consulate lost their flagship, Gideon met with Chandra, Liliana, and Saheeli to discuss how to destroy Tezzeret's construction. The Renegade artificers had constructed a special thopter that they would send to shut down Tezzeret's invention. Again distressed by the willingness of Liliana to harm innocents, Gideon tried to argue against her plan to confront the Grand Consul, but with no success. After the thopter had been destroyed by a raid of Dovin Baan, Chandra, and Gideon improvised, entering the thopter themselves. Chandra would blow up the construct with her fire magic, while Gideon would use his hieromancy to keep them both alive.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/breaking-points-2017-01-18|Breaking Points|[[Doug Beyer]]|January 18, 2017}}</ref> Their plan was successful in destroying the <c>planar bridge</c>, but Tezzeret managed to escape.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/puppets-2017-01-25|Puppets|[[James Wyatt]]|January 25, 2017}}</ref> \n\nAfter the revolt was over, Gideon inducted Ajani into the Gatewatch, telling him that they would be honored if he joined their ranks. Afterward, the Gatewatch came together to coordinate their future activities. Gideon agreed with Liliana and Jace that it would be too dangerous to leave Tezzeret alone and that their best chance would be to attack his master directly on Amonkhet.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/renewal-2017-02-01|Renewal|[[Mel Li]], [[Kelly Digges]], [[Alison Luhrs]], [[Doug Beyer]], and [[Chris L'Etoile]]|February 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Amonkhet===\n[[File:Gideons Defeat.jpg|left|thumb|209x209px|<c>Gideon's Defeat</c> at the hands of Bolas.]]\nGideon arrived at [[Amonkhet (plane)|Amonkhet]] together with the rest of the Gatewatch, finding himself in a desert filled with undead.

Feeling deep devotion again for the first time since he had dared to challenge Erebos, Gideon advised the rest of the Gatewatch to learn what they could about the plane before they would make their move. He went to Oketra's temple, pledging himself to her to face the [[Trials of the Five Gods]].<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/trust-2017-04-05|Trust|[[James Wyatt]]|April 5, 2017}}</ref> He was given a cartouche that symbolized his advancement, allowing him to enter the fourth trial with a new [[crop]] headed by [[Djeru]]. Learning about the faith of the people, he began to feel uneasy but thought nothing of it. When the crop was brought before [[Bontu]], Gideon and his new crop were brought to enter the trial. When Bontu told how none are born strong, Gideon asked her if this also holds for the gods. Bontu commemorated his brazenness and allowed his crop to begin. During the trial, he was horrified about the careless way the crop members treated the lives of their fellows, leaving wounded behind that could have been saved. When the crop came before Bontu, the god told them that their number was too great and that sacrifices of their fellow crop members were in order. Gideon was shocked when the rest of the crop cut down their comrades-in-arms and when he tried to intervene, the god's servants came to restrain him. When Bontu turned to him to demand a heart, Gideon defied her, to the shock of the crop. When they accused him of being a heretic, Bontu replied that he had not found faith and was, therefore, no heretic. Calling him out for judging a culture he did not grow up in and refused to understand, Bontu told him that even the crop members faced doubt, but that their ambition had helped them to transcend it and that this was what her trial taught. Gideon left the Monument, now at first realizing that the [[Anointed]] were those that had fallen in the trials.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/brazen-2017-05-03|Brazen|[[Michael Yichao]]|May 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\nRejoining with the Gatewatch, Gideon planned to free the dissenters and save the aspirants from the death that would await them in the trials. Gideon vowed to protect [[Samut]] from the dedicated before they were overwhelmed by all five gods to act as opponents in the final trial. Bound with cartouches that hindered the use of magic, they were forced to face the Worthy in battle. After the magic that had compelled them to fight dissipated, Gideon put himself between Hazoret and Djeru, \"saving\" him from the final reward of the trials. At this moment, [[Hazoret]] prophesied him that he would die by immortal hands and warned him that he was no god.<ref name=\"Judgment\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/judgment-2017-05-17|Judgment|[[Doug Beyer]] and [[Alison Luhrs]]|May 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the final confrontation with Bolas, the Gatewatch was soundly defeated by the dragon.

She ultimately became the [[Maro-Sorcerer]] of the [[Whispering Woods]].\n\n==Description==\nAlmost all the inhabitants of [[White Ridge]] had names referring to nature - the men's names were related to animals, and the women's were related to plants. Greensleeves was so named for her penchant to root in the grass, smearing green stains far up on her arms. She had thick, auburn-brown hair which curled and tended to be thick and wild. She wore threadbare green- and brown clothes with a thin shawl around her shoulders. She was quite small and thin for her age<ref name=\"wwoods\"/> until she was 17, when [[Chaney]]'s druidic magic caused her to bloom into womanhood, fleshing her form out.<ref name=\"shattered\"/>\n\nAs an adult, Greensleeves' auburn-brown hair fell in shimmering waves over her shoulders. Her skin was tanned, her face serene. She wore no jewelry, and her pale green, lichen-colored dress was very simple in cut. Her sleeves were slightly darker than the rest, and a belt of woven grass outlined her waist. Her cloak was all in green wool, embroidered with more details than could have been noticed in a day. Similar to the tapestries that adorn the walls of castles, it unrolled a multitude of scenes woven with shining threads.<ref name=\"fsacrifice\"/>\n\n==History==\n===Dim-witted===\nDuring her youth, Greensleeves lived peacefully with her brothers [[Gull]] and [[Sparrow Hawk]] in the village of [[White Ridge]], on the border of the [[Whispering Woods]]. She was perceived to be dim-witted because she couldn't talk, but only chattered in animal sounds to communicate simple emotions - fear, hunger, interest, etc. One day, in 4073 AR, a <c>falling star</c> was seen in the sky, which was reputed to be a bad omen. This was proven true when White Ridge was destroyed the next day during a [[wizard]]'s [[duel]]. During the [[Destruction of White Ridge]], many of the villagers were killed, including Greensleeves' parents and two of her siblings. Almost all the remaining villagers decided to relocate elsewhere. One of the dueling wizards, [[Towser]], came to Gull and, after assuring him he had no part in the destruction of the village, asked him to become his new freightmaster. Gull, confused by the mind magic of Towser and with nowhere else to go, accepted his offer and brought Greensleeves along.<ref name=\"wwoods\">[[Clayton Emery]] (1994) - ''[[Whispering Woods (novel)|Whispering Woods]]'', [[HarperPrism]].</ref>\n\n===Speaking===\nAfter a difficult slog through the forest, the Towser's wagon train reached its destination: the place where the star fell. The star was revealed by Towser to be a [[Mana Vault]], a powerful [[artifact]] that could store mana. During the night, the camp was attacked by another wizard who kidnapped Greensleeves and Gull's girlfriend, [[Lily]]. The wizard was defeated by a suddenly appearing <c>Fungusaur</c>. Finally, out of the Woods, the convoy stopped for the night near a [[swamp]]. During the night, though, [[Kem]], a [[bodyguard]] of Towser, was kidnapped by [[Troll#Dominaria|Sedge Trolls]], so Gull and Greensleeves entered the bog and saved him. The convoy then finally reached a coastal city. Gull was amazed to find out that Greensleeves suddenly could talk since it was the overwhelming magic of the Whispering Woods that had clouded her thoughts.<ref name=\"wwoods\"/>\n\n===Wizard===\nOne night, the siblings and Lily were kidnapped by Towser's minions. Back at the camp, the wizard revealed his intention to kill Greensleeves and store her power in the Mana Vault. A fight started, and Towser was forced to teleport away Gull, as well as his friends [[Morven]] and [[Stiggur]]. The three found themselves on a <c>tropical island</c>, where they met other creatures enslaved by Towser, including the centaurs [[Helki]] and [[Holleb]], and the giant [[Liko]]. It appeared that the island was where Towser would send his minions when he didn't need them and that there wasn't any way to escape from it. Still, Gull refused to surrender and started organizing the people on the island in a ragtag army, until one day he was summoned back by Lily who, unbeknownst to herself, was also a wizard. By that time, Towser had tied Greensleeves to an altar and he was ready to kill her when Kem changed sides and came to her rescue. At the same time, Greensleeves, who also was revealed to be a wizard (she had summoned the Fungusaur), started summoning her friends and all the creatures of the woods to fight Towser's minions. Still, Towser was a veteran wizard and could control his creatures better than Greensleeves. She resolved to use an <c>earthquake</c>, which destroyed the cliff they were on and plunged them into the sea. A <c>tsunami</c> cast by Greensleeves was coming, so Towser escaped with his <c>flight</c> spell. Gull, Greensleeves, and Stiggur escaped from the huge wave taking refuge in a crack in the cliffside, while Morven and Kem were swept away by the sea. After the water had settled, they found that Lily and some other friends had survived, including Helki, Holleb, and Liko. They vowed to form an army to fight Towser and all other evil wizards who saw people as mindless pawns.<ref name=\"wwoods\"/>\n\n===Archdruid===\nGreensleeves was compelled by a strange voice to leave the army camp and enter the woods, where she found a cave. This was the home of [[Chaney]], an old [[druid]], who was willing to teach the inexperienced Greensleeves everything she knew about magic. When Gull and the others found out about Greensleeves' disappearance, they quickly followed her trail. During her training, Greensleeves found out that [[time]] in Chaney's house flowed differently and what seemed to be mere days were indeed years. When Gull and the rest of the army finally found her, Greensleeves had grown up and become a much more skilled wizard.<ref name=\"shattered\">[[Clayton Emery]] (1995) - ''[[Shattered Chains]]'', [[HarperPrism]].</ref>\n\n===Planeswalker===\nWhile [[Rakel]] continued to drill the men and women of the army, transforming them into real soldiers, Greensleeves and Chaney discovered that the Mana Vault was in reality the \"[[Stone Brain]]\", a <c>living artifact</c> created by the Sages of [[Lat-Nam]] in hope to stop the [[Brothers' War]]. The brain had the power to stop wizards from using magic, so Greensleeves used it on [[List of secondary characters/Dominaria|Haakon]], the self-appointed King of the [[Badlands]]. When Haakon managed to free himself from the Stone Brain command just enough to summon some <c>Phyrexian Gremlins</c>, they snatched the artifact and returned to [[Phyrexia|their home plane]]. The only hope to save Rakel and recover the Stone Brain was to [[Planeswalker (lore)|planeswalk]] to their location, which Chaney claimed she was too old to do. However, the druid believed Greensleeves could do it and donated a [[Nova Pentacle]] to help her focus her mana. Greensleeves was successful in planeswalking to Phyrexia, bringing some of her friends with her. After being attacked by [[demon]]s, she teleported herself to the Stone Brain and donned it. She could resist the voices of the helmet, as they were similar to the effect of the Whispering Woods. Among the voices, Greensleeves found the spells she needed to destroy the demons, save her dying friends, and return home. Later, when Chaney died from old age, Greensleeves absorbed her life force to become an archdruid herself.<ref name=\"shattered\"/>\n\n===Final sacrifice===\nGull and Greensleeves' army grew into a formidable force and liberated almost all of North [[Aerona]] from evil wizards. However, all the fighting and death took their toll on Greensleeves. By 4077 AR, the druid just wanted some peace in the company of her lover [[Kwam]] and her brother Gull, who had married [[Lily]] and become the father of two daughters, [[Hyacinthe]] and [[Sweet]]. Greensleeves was supposed to regularly [[summon]] the wizards they had defeated and tagged with the [[Stone Brain]], but she was often too tired to do that. Greensleeves was also frequently visited by the shade of [[Chaney]], who advised the druid in cryptic words that she would need to make the \"final sacrifice\" to win the war.<ref name=\"fsacrifice\">[[Clayton Emery]] (1995) - ''[[Final Sacrifice]]'', [[Harper Prism]].</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, ten wizards under the leadership of [[Towser]] and [[Karli]] had regrouped and protected themselves from Greensleeves's magic. Aided by the [[elemental]] [[Ur-Drago]] and the huge <c>Keldon warlord</c> [[Ix]], who had a personal grudge against Gull, they attacked the army from three different directions. Greensleeved tries her best to help on every front, but the casualties were heavy. [[Petalia]], captain of her bodyguard, was lost in [[the Abyss]] when the druid banished Ur-Drago. In another part of the Woods, Gull was confronted by the [[Keld]]on warlord, but before the enemy could kill the woodcutter, Greensleeves teleported herself, Gull, and the survivors of their army to their headquarters, called Greensleeves' Grove. However, even the center of the Whispering Woods had been ravaged by the attackers. After seeing one of the wizards, [[Gurias]], kill another of her bodyguards, Greensleeves unleashed her fury, killing him and summoning her most powerful spells, which caused the enemy to flee.<ref name=\"fsacrifice\"/>\n\nGreensleeves understood that the evil wizards had found one another thanks to the Stone Brain, so she intends to discover every secret of the artifact. She donned the helmet once more, and found out that its ultimate secret was buried somewhere in the ruins of the [[College of Lat-Nam]], somewhere on the long-lost isle of [[Lat-Nam]]. The same night, Chaney's shade passed on to the afterlife, after reminding Greensleeves once more of the final sacrifice. The party teleported to Lat-Nam, a warm island partly covered by scrub forest and a poisoned glass desert, where once the College stood. The army was quickly attacked by the [[Angel#Duler Angels|Duler Angels]] and the [[merfolk]] of the Copper Conch. After several battles, Greensleeves parleyed with the angels and the merfolk, who had been tasked by the Sages to be guardians of Lat-Nam. Befriending them by explaining the common goal, the rest of the army was summoned to the ruins, and excavation was started. After unraveling a [[Dragon Engine]] and other traps, a tunnel was found, leading eventually to a cave by the ocean. The troops realized then that the rest of the college had collapsed and was underwater.<ref name=\"fsacrifice\"/>\n\nThe merfolk then brought Greensleeves to the [[Lord of Atlantis]], who carried the druid to the underwater portion of the College, where Greensleeves found the skull of a Sage. She mentally asked the skull for the secret of the Stone Brain. When the girl returned to the camp, she found out that they had been discovered by Towser and the other wizards, who were already attacking their army. After a long battle, the army retreated to the tunnel, where Gull had a prophetic dream about his dead family. Among them, he did not see [[Sparrow Hawk]], their long-lost brother, and this made him realize what the warlord's identity was.<ref name=\"fsacrifice\"/>\n\nTowser proposed a truce, to which Gull answered by asking for a personal duel between himself and the warlord. When Gull revealed to the Keldon warlord that the latter was in truth his brother Sparrow Hawk, who had been kidnapped and enchanted by Towser to be a war machine, the two brothers reconciled. However, [[List of secondary characters/Dominaria|Haakon]] unleashed a fireball against the two, who were engulfed in flames. This caused Greensleeves to go mad with anger and sorrow, making the \"final sacrifice\" of her ideal that every life was sacred. She blasted Haakon with a [[Lightning Bolt]], caused Queen [[Thunderhead]] to fall into a <c>fissure</c>, and then trapped the other wizards in the desert. She summoned a [[Force of Nature]], which drained the magic of the enemy mages, leaving them withered and weak. Absorbing the mana of the creature, a combination of that of the mages and of Lat-Nam's innate mana, Greensleeves became a godlike being and briefly lost herself completely, seeing her friends and family as mere ants compared to her.<ref name=\"fsacrifice\"/>\n\n===High Wizard of the Domains===\nBefore she could unleash her overwhelming power and destroy the isle, she was brought to her senses by Kwam, and saw that her brothers had survived Haakon's fireball thanks to the enchanted might of Sparrow Hawk. Greensleeves decided then instead of annihilating everyone to pour all of her mana into the Isle of Lat-Nam, curing the land of the poison and transforming the desert into a verdant forest. Healing the land let her release all her pent-up mana harmlessly, which reduced her back to her normal self.<ref name=\"fsacrifice\"/> This outpouring of mana caused Greensleeves to lose her spark.<ref>{{TwitterRef|jay13x|1738264188017889381|author=[[Jay Annelli]]|title=My thread on desparked planeswalkers.|date=December 22, 2023}}</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Battle of Lat-Nam]], the surviving evil wizards, stripped of their mana by the Force of Nature, were brought before the druid, who used the secret of the helmet revealed to her by the skull to strip Towser of his magic using the Stone Brain. Seeing how the punishment caused Towser to run away screaming madly, Gull found the solution too drastic and cruel, so he decided to let the other surviving wizards retain their magic, but only for doing good. Greensleeves kept to herself the last secret of the Stone Brain, its ability to give magic to anyone, thinking that a similar power was sure to cause another war for control over it. In the end, the wizards all pledged obedience to Greensleeves, who was declared High Wizard of the [[Domains]] by her followers.<ref name=\"fsacrifice\"/>\n\n===Maro-Sorcerer===\nHundreds of years later, sensing the return of the plane's [[Phyrexian|greatest enemies]], Greensleeves was reborn as the [[Maro-Sorcerer]] of the Whispering Woods, a being of pure elemental power. The former archdruid swore to protect not just the people of Dominaria, but the land itself.<ref name=\"DMU Legends\">{{DailyRef|feature/legends-youll-find-dominaria-united-2022-09-01|The Legends You'll Find in Dominaria United|[[Roy Graham]]|September 1, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{TwitterRef|EthanFleischer|1563731858151866368|author=[[Ethan Fleischer]]|title=THE MARO-SORCERER MEGATHREAD|date=August 28, 2022}}</ref>\n\n==On Greensleeves' spark==\nGreensleeves appeared only in early novels, in which the concept of a [[planeswalker's spark]] was not yet developed. At the time, any mage powerful enough could break the plane's veil with the right spells and sufficient [[mana]] and travel across the planes. To fit this with the later use of planeswalkers' sparks, one can ascribe the wizards who did manage to become planeswalkers by spells inately possessed sparks that were flared by the spells they cast, even if they did not know of these sparks or their role in becoming planeswalkers. It has later been explained that Greensleeves lost her spark when she restored the island of Lat-Nam.<ref>{{TwitterRef|jay13x|1738264188017889381|author=[[Jay Annelli]]|title=My thread on desparked planeswalkers.|date=December 22, 2023}}</ref>\n\n==On Greensleeves' mana==\nGreensleeves demonstrated the use of all 5 [[color]]s of [[mana]].

He was a [[red]] [[Wizard|telepath]] with the ability to overwhelm his opponent's mind with memories to disorient and even knock them unconscious, hence his nickname, the \"Mindbreaker.\"\n\nFollowing Garruk's escape from [[Odric]], Grith was summoned by Vronos in [[Innistrad (plane)|Innistrad]], along with other planeswalkers, to capture and bring Garruk to [[Avacyn]] to cure it. The group found Garruk in [[Alara]]. In the lands of [[Esper]], near a high spire, Grinth waited for Garruk and confronted him. Although Grinth initially reduced Garruk with his mental attacks, at the end of their confrontation he ended up lying dead on the ground, his armor undone and Garruk's axe marked on his broken breastplate.\n\n==Planeswalkers met==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n*[[Vronos]]\n*[[Kento]]\n*[[Boragor]]\n*\"[[Icy]]\"\n*[[Garruk Wildspeaker]]\n}}\n\n==Planes visited==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n*[[Innistrad (plane) | Innistrad]]\n*[[Alara]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Planeswalker|characters}}\n{{Unknown Plane|characters}}\n[[Category: Humans]]\n[[Category: Soldiers]]\n[[Category:Deceased]]",

She published numerous papers in a medical journal about her search for a cure for the spreading madness in the residents of Aykan.<ref name=\"Hidden Planeswalker 2\" /> She learned of [[Marit Lage]] and tried to harness Lage's power to heal the plane. However, she failed to take into account the enchantment binding Lage within the ice, and instead amplified that. This resulted in her deep-freezing Aykan, all its inhabitants, and herself for decades.<ref name=\":1\">Mairghread, Scott. (2022). ''[[Magic: The Hidden Planeswalker]]''. Vol 1, iss 3.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Amonkhet]], [[Liliana Vess]] had a vision of Isona verbally defying the power of [[Marit Lage]]. [[Tezzeret]] sought Isona for her amplification powers, and caused Liliana to become interested in the girl's safety from him, which naturally led him right to her.<ref name=\"Hidden Planeswalker 2\">Mairghread, Scott. (2022). ''[[Magic: The Hidden Planeswalker]]''. Vol 1, iss 2.</ref>\n\nDespite Isona's prejudice against [[Necromancer|necromancers]], she befriended her savior. However, when Isona learned of Liliana's role in the [[Battle of Amonkhet]], she began to shun Liliana. Tezzeret explained his plan to siphon Marit Lage's power with her help, and she agreed, believing he would help her heal Aykan. As payment, she was to kill Liliana. Liliana led her to {{Plane|innistrad}}, where a pack of {{Card|Doom Weaver|title=doom weavers}} imprisoned her in an underground cocoon for the next few decades with instructions to kill anyone else who tried to approach her.<ref name=\":0\">Mairghread, Scott.

[[Davriel Cane]] shut the machine down, however, and Isona cut off Tezzeret's connection to the aether, leaving him powerless. Davriel freed her from the siphoning cables, and she fled to [[Aminatou]]'s plane where she planned to alter fate.<ref name=\"Magic 20\">MacKay, Jed. (2022). ''[[Magic (BOOM! comic)|Magic]]''.

With the assistance of both, he attempted to [[Jace Beleren's attempt to fix the Multiverse|reshape the Multiverse]] by using the unique properties of the [[Meditation Realm]] as \"a substrate of reality\", with the aim of undoing the New Phyrexian invasion. His attempt led to the release of Nicol Bolas from his imprisonment, and Jace appears to have failed, becoming unmade.

Before becoming the Living Guildpact, he also had a burgeoning relationship with [[Emmara Tandris]], one of his first friends on Ravnica, but she could not bear to share the knowledge of the multiverse and planeswalkers with the [[Selesnya]] and asked to have it removed from her mind and with it most of Jace's identity. Finally, [[Vraska]] and Jace have been involved since their sojourn on Ixalan.\n\n==History==\n===Adolescence===\n[[File:Jace vs Alhammarret.jpg|left|thumb|247x247px|Jace confronts his master Alhammarret]]\nJace was born at [[Silmot's Crossing]] on the [[plane]] of [[Vryn]]. His unique gift of telepathy manifested very early in his life, often to his parents' immense embarrassment. When his block's cart horse [[List of secondary characters#Vryn|Pewter]] fell ill, Jace created an [[illusion]]ary double, maintaining it for weeks after the horse's death.<ref name=\"OTJ Epilogue 2\"/> Desperate to curb the young man's precocious nature, his father [[Gav Beleren]] sought the assistance of the local mage known as [[Alhammarret]]. Alhammarret took Jace from his father and allowed him to become his apprentice at age thirteen. Under his tutelage, Jace spent years learning new [[spells]] and talents, but most importantly, he began to feel welcome for the first time in memory.\n\nIt was not to last though. Jace eventually became strong enough to try his talents against his master and learned the shocking truth of his existence. He discovered that his [[spark]] had ignited over a year ago, dipping him into the [[Blind Eternities]] only for a moment. Alhammarret had lied to him about what had happened, telling him his illusions had backfired and not to concern himself with it. Alhammarret confided in Jace's father about the event, and they agreed to keep the truth from Jace.\n\nJace seethed over this news for days, holding his temper close to his heart until finally, during one of their practice sessions, Jace snapped. He slipped into Alhammarret's mind and unleashed all of his rage and pain at once, destroying his master's mind. Jace fled, assuming he would be wanted everywhere within a hundred miles of his hometown. Ironically, due to Alhammarret's death and his disappearance, Jace was presumed dead alongside his master.<ref name=\"OTJ Epilogue 2\"/> Finally, Jace erased his memories, so that he would never have to see his teacher's face again, and feel the weight of what he had done.\n\n====Revised origin====\n[[File:Jace Memories.jpg|thumb|250x250px|With his mind shattered from the confrontation with Alhammarret, Jace's spark ignites]]\nIn a more recent update to Jace's origin, Alhammarret was revealed to be a [[sphinx]] who arbitrated between the two warring factions of Vryn.<ref>{{DailyRef|feature/jaces-origin-absent-minds-2015-06-24|Jace’s Origin: Absent Minds|[[Kelly Digges]]|June 24, 2015}}</ref> After two years of training, Alhammarret began sending Jace out to gather information. Under the cover of darkness and cloaked by [[illusion]]s, Jace would sneak into a camp of one of the opposing sides to learn about the army's battle plans. During one of these reconnaissance missions, Jace tried to enter his master's mind, a feat he had never accomplished before. He learned the shocking truth of his existence: his spark had ignited a year ago, dipping him into the Blind Eternities only for a moment. Alhammarret had lied to him about what had happened and had repeatedly wiped the incident from the young man's mind.<ref name=\"The Flood\"/> When Jace finally found out, he began to erase his knowledge to keep it away from the sphinx. Instead, he kept records on paper.\n\nLater it turned out that Alhammarret was playing both warring factions against each other by providing them with military intel, and thus keeping his status as arbiter intact. He used Jace as a go-between, to gather information from the Ampryn and the Trovians, deliver it, and learn more just in the delivery. And every time, he'd wiped Jace's memory of it, taken the money for himself, and kept the war going.\n\nEventually, Jace goaded his master into a duel of telepathy. At the cost of much of his mind (and, inadvertently, his memories), he destroyed the Sphinx's mind, rendering Alhammarret unable to breathe.<ref name=\"The Flood\"/> The force of the battle, in combination with the damage done to himself, forced Jace to accidentally planeswalk away, landing himself in the streets of [[Ravnica]].\n\n===''Agents of Artifice''===\nOn [[Ravnica]] he settled into a comfortable life, living in the upper echelons of society and earning his money through blackmail. He would use his telepathy to learn the secrets of the wealthy and extort money from them for his continued silence. While conducting business, Jace was attacked by creatures summoned by members of the [[Infinite Consortium]]. After some brief background research, Jace confronted the Consortium's master [[Tezzeret]] and learned that these attacks were, in fact, an \"invitation\" for Jace to join [[Tezzeret]]'s organization. With some hesitation, Jace agreed and began training with Tezzeret to hone his telepathy for the Consortium's use.<ref name=\"aoa\">[[Ari Marmell]] (2009). ''[[Agents of Artifice]]'', [[Wizards of the Coast]]. ISBN-13 978-0786951345</ref>\n\nAt one point, Jace was sent to the abandoned plane of [[Thunder Junction]] to investigate the contents of an [[Maag Taranau|ancient vault]]. He was chosen for the task because Tezzeret's master [[Nicol Bolas]] feared the vault's contents and Tezzeret was unable to get inside. Reaching inside with his telepathy, he found a childlike presence blocked by a psychic barrier. When he reported his findings to Tezzeret, the elder planeswalker had no interest in exploring further.\n\nJace was partnered with a blademaster by the name of [[Kallist Rhoka]], who by some coincidence looked remarkably like Jace, and together they began to train each other in their specialties between assignments. After a few years, Jace came to realize how badly the Consortium's practices had impacted him and began to feel guilty, ironically, of not feeling any guilt over some of the things he has done in the Consortium's name. Things started to come to a head when a mission to [[Kamigawa]] ended spectacularly with the massacre of a [[Nezumi]] village. As punishment, Tezzeret savagely beats Jace for failing, though the mission failed through no fault of Jace's.<ref name=aoa/>\n\nShortly thereafter, an agent of Nicol Bolas, the original master of the Infinite Consortium and Tezzeret's main rival, contacted Tezzeret over a mining dispute on an unknown plane. Tezzeret scheduled a meeting with the dragon on an Arctic plane and brought Jace along to ensure that Bolas did not attempt to probe Tezzeret's mind. Jace became distracted by the dragon, who held two conversations with them both. Jace's defenses, which were untested, to begin with, failed when Bolas struck. After fleeing for their lives from Bolas's forces, Jace succumbed to frostbite and lost a toe. This was the least of his injuries though, as Tezzeret used his [[manablade]] to torture Jace for having failed despite his inexperience and the vast difference between his power and that which Bolas possessed.<ref name=aoa/>\n[[File:Jace vs Tezzeret.png|thumb|244x244px|Jace vs Tezzeret|alt=|left]]\nFinally, Jace grew uneasy with Tezzeret's methods and total lust for power, and after refusing a task that went against his very nature, he ultimately fell out of Tezzeret's graces. Jace took Kallist with him and ran to the farthest reaches of Ravnica in hopes of escaping the Consortium's wrath. While trying to lie low, the pair ran into the lovely necromancer [[Liliana Vess]], who flirted endlessly with both of them, finally settling into a torrid affair with Jace. Without Jace's knowledge, and with a heavy heart, Liliana revealed where Jace and Kallist had settled to the Consortium. In a desperate attempt to save both their lives, Jace tried to absorb Kallist's mind and switched bodies with the assassin when it failed.<ref name=aoa/>\n\nSix months later, \"Jace\" in Kallist's body died and his mind returned to its original body with extreme trauma to Jace's psyche. Liliana took him away to recover and urged him to pursue Tezzeret for his part in Kallist's death. This resulted in Tezzeret and Jace scheming against each other, Tezzeret trying to kill Jace for his insubordination and impudence, and Jace just wanting to be free from Tezzeret and the Consortium finally. Jace turned to Nicol Bolas for help in locating Tezzeret's sanctum, and he and Liliana planned an assault on the artificer's base. Ultimately, the attack failed, Jace was captured, and Liliana's betrayal came to light. Tezzeret spent months constructing an artifact to control Jace's mind without damaging his abilities, all the while having Jace tortured violently by the pyromancer [[Baltrice]]. Liliana approached the captured Jace and tried to make him understand the reasons she'd done the things she had. She genuinely cared for him, and she helped Jace escape the prison Tezzeret constructed. Together they again attempted to destroy Tezzeret, wreaking havoc in his base of operations. Ultimately, Jace and the artificer dueled, resulting in Jace wiping Tezzeret's mind clean, leaving the consortium without a leader. Jace made a vow to himself to help Liliana in any way that he could.<ref name=aoa/>\n\n===''The Purifying Fire''===\nAt some point during Jace's first year working for the Infinite Consortium, he was sent to track down and retrieve a scroll [[Chandra]] had stolen from the Sanctum of Stars in [[Kephalai]]. However, his mission was to erase all memories of it from the pyromancer's mind, and not just to return the scroll to Kephalai. He tracked her to the monastery of [[Keral Keep]] where he confronted the girl. After a short battle, Jace completed his objective and planeswalked away.<ref name=TPF> ''[[The Purifying Fire]]''</ref>\n\n===Zendikar===\n[[File:Jace eldrazi.jpg|thumb|214x214px|Jace is attacked by an Eldrazi]]\nRoughly three years after retrieving the Dragon Scroll from Chandra, Jace's interest in it was once more piqued for an unknown reason. With [[Garruk Wildspeaker|Garruk's]] \"assistance\", Jace soon decoded the location in the scroll as [[Zendikar]]. Shortly thereafter, he followed in Chandra's footsteps, having hired a guide to climb through the mountains of [[Akoum]].<ref name=\"Journey\">[[Jenna Helland]] (2009), \"''[[Journey to the Eye]]''\", [[Wizards of the Coast]]</ref> Using his skill at illusion to keep himself safe, he and his guide soon encountered the bedraggled [[Anowon]], who attacked Jace and killed his treacherous guide. Subduing Anowon, Jace ripped the information he sought from the vampire's mind and convinced him to replace his guide to the [[Eye of Ugin]].\n[[File:Jace vs Eldrazi.jpg|left|thumb|221x221px]]\nUpon arriving at the Eye, a wall closed between the two, with Anowon shouting warnings at Jace that fell on deaf ears. What Jace found, much to his surprise, was an immense [[Sarkhan Vol|Dragon]] fighting Chandra, who was hard-pressed to continue the fight.<ref name=\"Awakenings\">[[Doug Beyer]] (2010), \"''[[Awakenings]]''\", [[Wizards of the Coast]]</ref> Jace immediately offered his help but was stunned to find his spells malfunctioning and one of the Hedrons floating about the cave absorbing his magic. Acting upon intuition and things he had gleaned from the scroll that led him here, Jace told Chandra to try and generate fire that could not be seen. With it, the pair defeated Sarkhan, knocking the entire group unconscious. Chandra was the first to awake and pulled Jace to his feet before walking away, leaving Jace to ponder who had manipulated the pair into crossing paths.\n\nWith Chandra gone, Jace had no reason to stay in the Eye. With his goal accomplished, albeit catastrophically, he wandered the caves and questioned once more how all three walkers came to be in the same place at the appropriate time.<ref name=\"Enter\">[[Brady Dommermuth]] (2010), \"''[[Enter the Eldrazi]]''\", [[Wizards of the Coast]]</ref> Despite his ignorance of the plane and the Eye, Jace couldn't help but notice that something had been set in motion with his involvement. He resolved to inform the sages of Sea Gate at [[Halimar]] of this development, but before he could leave the labyrinth, Anowon returned, demanding to know what had happened. Before Jace had a chance to answer, the vampire sage stalked off into the heart of the Eye muttering to himself. With no guide, Jace managed to find a nearby town and acquired a mount to ride. Wasting no time, he began his trek back to the ship to finish his voyage. On the way, an enormous member of the <c title=\"Eldrazi Brood\">Pathrazer of Ulamog</c> attacked, killing Jace's mount but leaving the mind mage unscathed. Jace arrived at the boat and continued on his way.\n\nTwo weeks later, Jace stood consulting an archivist at the Lighthouse of Halimar. He learned a bit about the Eldrazi but felt no wiser for the knowledge. He recounted the events of his journey for her and decided to search out where Chandra learned of the scroll. The merfolk archivist begged Jace to return if he learned anything, and Jace walked away saying he would share anything he found.\n\n===Return to Ravnica===\n[[File:Jace's Sanctum.jpg|thumb|234x234px|Jace's Sanctum.]]\nAfter the tumult of the past few years of his life, Jace ignored whatever obligations remained on Ravnica, choosing to just wander for a while. When he returned, the consortium had collapsed without him, but he couldn't seem to bring himself to care. Indeed, despite feeling at home in Ravnica's faceless masses, Jace was haunted by the things he had seen. It was no wonder, then, that when curious symbols and patterns started turning up all over the Tenth District, it was enough to make Jace pause and take note. It was just the distraction he needed.\n\nJace contacted a peer named Kavin, a [[vedalken]], with whom he worked to unwind the puzzle of the mysterious marks and why the [[Izzet League]] was interested in them. Unlike his accomplice though, Jace's interest turned to near obsession. He worked feverishly, and fruitlessly, until [[Emmara]] took note of his absence and came to check on him. After several pleasantries, she gave Jace a <c title=\"small wooden pendant\">Selesnya Signet</c> and offered Jace a place in the Conclave. He refused, but she still asked for his assistance. Jace was not the only one to have noticed the Izzet's flurry of activity. Unfortunately, the pair had also attracted the attention of [[House Dimir]].\n\nSeveral days after, Jace secretly tracked [[Ral Zarek]] and his associates back to the <c>Izzet Guildgate</c>. He was shocked to find [[Niv-Mizzet]] himself waiting for Zarek and with his chance slipping through his fingers, he seized the opportunity, making a mental connection with the firemind itself. Jace attained the answers he sought but at the cost of attracting the attention of the dragon.\n\nKavin was not as thrilled with Jace's answers as the young telepath had been. The archivist was insistent they walk away, and reluctantly, Jace agreed, even going so far as to erase the memories of six months' worth of work. Unfortunately, while Jace worked at that, the [[Cult of Rakdos]] abducted Emmara. Jace immediately went after them as soon as he awoke, distraught at both the abduction and the sudden gap in his memories. The forces of the [[Azorius Senate]] had other plans for him though. Eluding [[Lavinia]] and the arresters with the help of [[Ruric Thar]], Jace desperately tried to piece together what had happened and how he could help Emmara. The only clue he had was a small token pointing him to a Rakdos nightclub. After a less than pleasant discourse at the club with the blood witch [[Exava]], Jace escaped the cult and made his way to the [[Golgari]] controlled neighborhoods of District Ten, having snatched the location out of the mind of the Rakdos. Following the power of a [[leyline]], Jace encountered [[Varolz]], only to have Emmara save him. While distracted, [[Mirko Vosk]] struck.\n[[File:Implicit Maze Jace.jpg|left|thumb|245x245px|Jace research on the Implicit Maze of Azor]]\nThe vampire gravely wounded Emmara and tried to psychically assault Jace, finding the mage knew nothing of what he had been looking for. The vampire retreated, frustrated that Jace had been one step ahead. After tending their wounds, the pair headed back to [[Vitu-Ghazi]]. When they arrived, Emmara was received warmly and Jace with suspicion. Jace was introduced to Emmara's paramour, Captain [[List of secondary characters/Ravnica|Calomir]]. This discovery shook Jace worse than almost everything that had happened to him up until that point. Emmara's abduction had sparked hostility within the conclave, spearheaded by Calomir. Jace, feeling put upon, tried to read the man, only to discover he couldn't. He quickly deduced Calomir wasn't who he said he was, but Jace's suspicions were ill-received, and he was quickly thrown from Conclave territory.\n\nLeft drifting listlessly, Jace couldn't shake the feeling that Emmara was in danger, as his friend was the only thing important to him in the entirety of Ravnica. So, with few other options, Jace turned to Lavinia, the Azorius lawmage who had been sent to arrest him in the first place. He shared what he knew of the plots the Dimir were weaving, and in exchange, he tried to trade that knowledge for whatever the Azorius knew of what he had forgotten. Unfortunately, Lavinia was not in such a giving mood, and his only lead became the [[Gruul]] ogre he had hired to destroy his sanctum.\n\nJace managed to track Ruric Thar down and while trying to discover whatever secret he had uncovered, unintentionally challenged the ogre to combat. Unable to use his magic against the pair, Jace found unexpected empathy from the Gruul warriors watching the fight. Jace tapped into those thoughts and used them to beat the ogre. Having proven himself, Ruric Thar agreed to let Jace search his mind, and the planeswalker found bits of what he was looking for, enough to go on, but at that moment, Exava, leading a riot of her cultists finally tracked him down. The Gruul put themselves in between the cultists and Jace, but he was reluctant to leave them to their fates. He summoned a gigantic illusion of Rakdos himself and commanded the riot back into their territory.\n\nExava was livid, but could not overcome the awe Jace's effigy inspired. However, once they returned, they found the Conclave forces waiting. It was enough to break Jace's concentration and Exava once again managed to corner him. The riot came to an abrupt end as Niv Mizzet made a district-wide announcement, revealing very nearly every secret behind the ''Implicit Maze'' Jace had worked so hard to learn again. With the announcement made, Exava prepared to torture Jace, but he was saved at the last moment by [[Lazav]]. The shapeshifter ferried him away into the undercity, explaining many of his plans to the telepath before turning him over to the tender ministrations of Mirko Vosk once more. With little choice, he planeswalked away from the Dimir prison, but not before Vosk managed to get the maze route from Jace's mind as he desperately shared it with Emmara.\n\nAwakening on Zendikar, Jace considered just leaving it all behind and abandoning Ravnica altogether. An encounter with a [[kor]] family changed his mind though, and he determined to help Emmara, so he returned. His first destination was the Forum of Azor, the endpoint of the maze. There, he discovered the Bailiff, a magical being made of law that was bound to the Maze. The construct told him that he was the executor of Azor's judgment and that if the guilds completed the trial, a new [[Guildpact]] would be actualized by the most worthy. If they didn't, he would deliver the <c>Supreme Verdict</c> of Azor.\n\nWith new questions about the maze, he tracked Lavinia to a meeting where [[Isperia]] and a disguised Lazav were discussing the Verdict. Isperia told the pair that it was a spell that could destroy all the guilty in a district, and they realized that the Supreme Verdict would be the verdict to the trial of the maze. More determined than ever, Jace made his way to the <c>Transguild Promenade</c> for the starting ceremony. There, he reconnected with Emmara and told her what he had discovered.\n\nAs soon as the maze began, chaos broke out, but Jace and Emmara managed to make their way through the Selesnyan and Golgari gates, however, upon reaching the Azorius gate, the pair were forced to separate as Lavinia arrested him for his long-overdue transgressions. A special trial was held with Isperia herself acting as judge. Jace explained everything he had discovered and how he intended to help. He pleads guilty, if for nothing else than to hurry the trial along. His penance was community service to help the guild champions to complete the maze.\n\nTrying to reach Emmara, he passed through Dimir and Orzhov gates until he found her, fighting [[Teysa Karlov]]. He manipulated the Envoy's servants to attack each other, but the plan backfired, causing them to lash out against Teysa, who quickly wiped out her forces. Jace traded the rest of the maze's route for Teysa's delay, leaving her behind and proceeding to the Simic and Izzet gates with Emmara.\n[[File:Jace, the Living Guildpact.jpg|thumb|271x271px|Jace, the Living Guildpact]]\nAt the Izzet gate, however, he found Ral Zarek waiting for him. Ral forced Jace to reveal his identity to Emmara, that Jace was a planeswalker as well. The news caused Emmara to lose the trust she had placed in him. Betrayed, Emmara proceeded through the gate, but Ral had no intention of letting Jace cross. He planned to kill the telepath instead. Jace very nearly lost the battle as Ral unleashed the full might of his preparations on the rival planeswalker, only surviving through the quick use of an illusion to lure away the Izzet guildmage.\n\nWhen he reached the Forum of Azor, all the maze-runners were assembled and attacking each other. He managed to stop them momentarily, but Lazav appeared and manipulated the champions into fighting once more. The bailiff appeared and seeing the situation, delivered the Supreme Verdict, which was to give every runner the ability to activate it. Jace connected their ten minds to prevent any from casting the verdict. He had merged their minds, letting them peer directly into each other's minds, but it was unraveling his mind in the process. Fortunately, the bailiff assisted him, easing the burden he had put upon himself. In doing so, the Bailiff had declared Jace the new Guildpact, the mediator who could understand the perspective of each of the guilds.\n\nJace met Emmara some days later. She kissed him as a gesture of gratitude, but she wanted him to erase the memories she had about other worlds and planeswalkers. She could not share that with her guild, and to do her duty, she could have no secrets. Regretfully, Jace granted her request.\n\n===Living as the Guildpact===\nJace continued his wandering of the planes but spent much of his time rushing back to Ravnica. With Lavinia's help, the office of the guildpact was being maintained, but a threat delivered directly at him forced Jace to pay closer attention. The planeswalker [[Vraska]] manipulated Jace into a confrontation, in her bid to gain control of Jace as the Living Guildpact. Jace neutralized Vraska for the moment, but his attention was drawn once more off-world as something Vraska said to him took root. Leaving Lavinia in charge of the office once more, Jace left Ravnica to find what had befallen Garruk Wildspeaker.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/gorgon-and-guildpact-2014-03-12|The Gorgon and the Guildpact|[[Doug Beyer]]|March 12, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Unfinished Business===\nIn his investigation following Vraska's ominous warnings, Jace learned that the corrupted Garruk intended to complete his transformation by returning to the Onakke Temple on Shandalar. Garruk's transformation would turn him into a demon and destroy the plane in the process. Jace realized that this would leave other worlds, including Ravnica, in danger. Jace took steps to hunt down [[Ob Nixilis]] on Zendikar to extract the hedron in his head which Nahiri had used to suppress the demonic ex-planeswalker's power. Jace arrived on Shandalar to make preparations for the upcoming battle where Garruk appeared shortly afterward. During the titanic battle, the temple began to crumble around them before Jace succeeded in implanting the hedron in Garruk and halting the curse of the chain veil.<ref>{{DailyRef|feature/checking-planeswalkers-2015-2015-08-19|Checking in on the Planeswalkers (2015)|[[Mel Li]]|August 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Jace was still unsure about Garruk's condition following the confrontation and sought him out. Masking himself as Liliana, Jace once more appeared before Garruk. However, the ruse was not effective and Garruk explained that though he was cursed, he enjoyed what he had become and wanted nothing more than to be left alone. With a final warning, Garruk told Jace that if he didn't heed his wishes, he wouldn't escape their next meeting.<ref>{{DailyRef|monster-2014-08-20|Monster|[[Ken Troop]]|August 20, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140822172829/https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/ur/monster-2014-08-20|archivedate=August 22, 2024}}</ref>\n\n===Odd partners===\nCurious about the Living Guildpact that had foiled his plans, Niv-Mizzet assigned Ral Zarek to trace Jace and research his many sudden disappearances.

Having found out that [[Jori En]] -- Gideon's merfolk friend -- was trapped at Sea Gate, Gideon left to find her and to bring her back to Jace hoping that together they might be able to link Zendikar's leylines with the hedrons to find a way to stop the Eldrazi again.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/slaughter-refuge-2015-08-19|Slaughter at the Refuge|[[James Wyatt]]|August 19, 2015 }}</ref> Jace and Jori En figured out that they had to travel to the [[Eye of Ugin]] in [[Akoum]] because that was where all the leylines connected.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/believers-pilgrimage-2015-09-02|The Believers' Pilgrimage|[[Doug Beyer]]|September 2, 2015}}</ref> On their way there, the two were ambushed by the [[Eternal Pilgrims]], a group of [[Kor]] who worshipped [[Ula|Mangeni Ula]], their name for [[Ulamog]]. Barely escaping the titan itself, Jace and Jori En realized that Ulamog was heading for Sea Gate. They then decided to split up, Jace continuing to Akoum and Jori En heading back to alert Gideon of the coming disaster.\n\nFinally arriving at the Eye, Jace found [[Ugin]] himself rebuilding the chamber and the hedron network. The Spirit Dragon revealed how the network might be used to again immobilize the Eldrazi titans, but Jace realized that the same trick might instead serve as a first step in killing them. Ignoring Ugin's dire warnings, Jace left the Eye and made his way back to Sea Gate to pass this information on to Gideon.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/revelation-eye-2015-10-14|Revelation at the Eye|[[Kelly Digges]]|October 14, 2015}}</ref> When Ulamog attacked, the Planeswalkers enacted a bold plan. While Gideon's troops and Kiora's forces held the city against this fresh assault, [[Nissa Revane]] called on the [[elemental]] power of the earth to raise sunken hedrons from the ground and move them into a ring around the Eldrazi titan. Jace activated the hedrons' magic, and Ulamog was trapped! Then everything collapsed. [[Ob Nixilis]] appeared, having followed Nissa from [[Bala Ged]].<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/hedron-alignment-2015-11-18|Hedron Alignment|[[Kimberly J.

As a final insult to the defenders and the plane itself, Ob Nixilis used his newfound power to coax the second Eldrazi Titan, Kozilek from its hiding spot under the plane's crust. Although Chandra Nalaar had also arrived to help, the defenders were scattering in panic. Earlier, Jace had attempted to direct Nissa to move several hedrons which would enable him to kill Ulamog but she ignored him and attempted to charge the titan herself with Ashaya. However, Kozilek and Ob Nixilis broke the hedron alignment and scattered the defenders. As Nissa fell to Ob Nixilis, he attempted to mentally manipulate the demon to leave but was countered and nearly killed by Ob Nixilis.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/retaliation-ob-nixilis-2015-12-30|Retaliation of Ob Nixilis|[[Kimberly J.

After consulting with Nissa, he described the leyline pattern to her that would bind Kozilek and Ulamog to Zendikar, drawing the bulk of the Titans into the plane so that their energy could be dispersed into Zendikar, killing them in the process. To attract them, the remaining forces of Zendikar's defenders would pose as bait.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/brink-extinction-2016-02-10|Brink of Extinction|[[Kelly Digges]]|February 10, 2016}}</ref> While the plan worked at first, with Gideon keeping the Eldrazi swarms away from the army, Kiora clearing out any other swarms and Chandra supporting them, once the Eldrazi titans were anchored to Zendikar, their destructive essence threatened to assimilate Zendikar into themselves. Afraid, Kiora tried to persuade Nissa to release the Titans and allow them to flee, but Jace objected. Chandra offered to burn the Titans instead and after preventing Kiora from attacking Nissa, Jace agreed. The pyromancer then connected with the animist, allowing her to channel her pyromantic magic through Zendikar's leylines directly into the Titans. In one brilliant blaze of flame, Ulamog and Kozilek were incinerated and destroyed, leaving only ashes raining from Zendikar's sky.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/zendikars-last-stand-2016-02-17|Zendikar's Last Stand|[[Doug Beyer]]|February 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Innistrad===\n[[File:Jace and Liliana Vess.jpg|left|thumb|245x245px|Jace asks Liliana for help in finding Sorin Markov]]\nAfter the defeat of the Eldrazi titans, Jace and his friends were berated by [[Ugin]] for killing the ancient creatures.

His attempts to read her mind were not successful, as he was harried by several illusions of himself within his mind. When he reached the Drownyard Temple, he saw nothing. Tamiyo's journal, however, seemed to indicate that the purpose of the cryptoliths that concentrated ley energy there was to relocate a large celestial object near Innistrad to pose as its additional moon. As he saw the undead tending to the Cryptoliths, he began to suspect Liliana of complicity in the fate of Markov Manor. As he saw angels clustering around the site, he heard a buzzing voice within his head that assured him that Liliana was behind this.

Liliana, however, refused to, bringing Jace back to his senses by stating that she didn't wish to hurt him anymore. Jace articulated his suspicions, that Liliana was trying to use the redirected mana to free herself of the Chain Veil. During their talk, the maddening influence of the cryptoliths reasserted itself and Jace asked Liliana for directions to [[Thraben]] so he could confront [[Avacyn]].<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/lilianas-indignation-2016-04-20|Liliana's Indignation|[[Kelly Digges]]|April 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn Thraben, Jace met [[Tamiyo]] herself.

However, as the leylines were already controlled by the cryptoliths, Nissa could not use the seal that she had used on Zendikar. They decided to try and use two smaller leylines and link them to Chandra to assault Emrakul.\n\n[[File:Epiphany at the Drownyard.jpg|thumb|248x248px|After finding Tamiyo's diary, Jace begins to investigate what is happening in Innistrad.|alt=|left]]The plan did not work, because the Gatewatch found themselves under constant assault from Emrakul's corrupted minions and Innistrad's leylines did not obey Nissa in the same way those on Zendikar did. They were saved by Liliana, who arrived with an army of undead that she had raised on the way to Thraben. Despite initial objections from Nissa and Gideon, they came to work together.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/battle-thraben-2016-07-20|Battle of Thraben|[[Nik Davidson]]|July 20, 2016}}</ref> Under the weight of Emrakul's mental influence, Jace was forced to take the other members of the Gatewatch under his mental protection. Within his mental domain, he witnessed the fears of his friends and eventually came to a chamber of his mind where he was greeted by an [[angel]] figure resembling the Zendikari deity [[Emeria]]. The figure proved very polite and conversed with him, even challenging him to a match of chess. While Jace won the game, all his figures transformed and turned against his king by the end of the game. Realizing that the Emeria-creature was his attempt to make sense of Emrakul's attempt at communication, Jace fled into another room of his mind, where he met a representation of himself that upheld the spell that protected his friends from the mental assault from the titan. Communicating with the rest of the Gatewatch, Jace combined forces with Nissa and Tamiyo to trap Emrakul in [[Innistrad Moon|Innistrad's moon]], while Gideon and Chandra would keep the other Eldrazi away from them. Though their attempts were fruitful at first, the spell nearly failed until Tamiyo used another spell scroll that managed to seal Emrakul.\n\nLater, Jace and Tamiyo met in private. Tamiyo revealed that she had been overtaken by Emrakul when she had cast the second spell, that the spell she had used was not the original that had been written on the scroll, and that Emrakul had wanted to be sealed in the moon. Deeply unsettled, the two parted ways, with Jace pondering what Emrakul's greater plan was.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/promised-end-2016-07-27|The Promised End|[[Ken Troop]]|July 27, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Back on Ravnica===\nIn the three months that followed, the Gatewatch made their headquarters on [[Ravnica]], within Jace's apartments. Thanks to the aid of Tamiyo, they received an emissary from the Consulate of [[Kaladesh]], the [[Vedalken]] [[Dovin Baan]]. The Vedalken wanted to hire the Gatewatch to provide protection for an Inventor's Fair that would take place in Ghirapur. Liliana, however, quickly made it clear that the Gatewatch intended to combat other planeswalkers and similar extraplanar threats, not local unrest. Additionally, several influential members of the [[Azorius Senate]] of Ravnica had been petrified, leaving Jace to believe that [[Vraska]], a rival planeswalker, could have returned.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/homesick-2016-08-29|Homesick|[[Chris L'Etoile]]|August 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nMeeting at a Rakdos Carnarium with Ral Zarek, the Izzet mage informed him that [[Project Lightning Bug]], despite no longer receiving attention from Niv-Mizzet, still showed when and where a planeswalker entered Ravnica. Ral Zarek told him that Vraska had indeed been on Ravnica, but then planeswalked seemingly into nothing. He warned Jace not to leave Ravnica for some time, only to be interrupted by Liliana Vess, who reported that she had seen Tezzeret on Kaladesh.

When the Gatewatch revealed itself and faced Tezzeret and his metallic creations, Jace realized that the whole thing had been arranged, since Tezzeret's mind was protected against his telepathy, meaning that he had anticipated at least his presence.\n\nJoining the rest of the Gatewatch in their support of the [[Renegades]], Jace mainly undertook reconnaissance missions and worked with sky pirates to hamper the aether supply of the Consulate.

As his mind falls into darkness, Jace instinctively planeswalks away. Jace didn't consciously choose where to go, but his destination was the result of pieces of memory as they fled from his mind. More than anything, it was an instinctive urge to leave that made him get sucked down to one specific very hidden place: [[Ixalan (plane)|Ixalan]].<ref>{{WebRef|url=https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/magic-story-podcast-ixalan-2017-08-30|title=''Magic'' Story Podcast: Ixalan|author=[[Blake Rasmussen]] and [[Alison Luhrs]]|date=August 30, 2017|work=[[magicthegathering.com]]|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200531071859/https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/magic-story-podcast-ixalan-2017-08-30|archivedate=2020-05-31}}</ref> When he arrived he had no memory of who or what he was.

On reaching the edge of the city, Jace and Vraska witnessed the rise of a [[Zetalpa|gigantic dinosaur]]. As they walked through the city, they reached a gigantic door, engraved with the symbol of the [[Azorius Senate]]. When Jace opened it, he and Vraska beheld the form of [[Azor]], who reminded Jace much of Alhammarret. The ancient [[parun]] of the Ravnican guild read Vraska's mind as she prepared to attack him, but Jace managed to block him.

At Jace's recommendation, they decided to split up into teams to focus on specific tasks. Jace, Jaya, Teferi, and [[Vivien]] volunteered to assassinate Liliana. Jace had a lot of conflicting feelings about their mission: rationally, he knew that it was the right thing to do, but he still cared for her and wished that there was a way to help her. When they found Liliana, Teferi warped time around her, slowing her ability to react, defend herself, or strike back at her attackers. This allowed Jaya and Vivien to badly wound her with fire, arrows, and animal spirits, although the [[Onakke]] spirits in Liliana's [[Chain Veil]] protected her. Nonetheless, they almost succeeded, but Bolas stepped in and saved Liliana by destroying the buildings they were standing on. Fortunately, Teferi saved himself and the other three planeswalkers by slowing their falls. \n\nLater, Jace reunited with Vraska. He tried to restore her memories, only to find that they'd already been restored by a Golgari telepath. Vraska confessed that even though she was fully aware of the threat Bolas posed, she still murdered Isperia in a fit of rage, despite knowing that it would help further Bolas' plans. Jace forgave her and promised to get together with her if they made it out of the war alive.<ref name=\"Ashes\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/war-spark-ravnica-ashes-2019-06-12|War of the Spark: Ravnica – Ashes|[[Greg Weisman]]|June 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\nJace witnessed Gideon sacrificing his life to save Liliana. When Chandra tries to kill Liliana (believing she'd killed Gideon), Jace stops her by explaining the situation. After Bolas' defeat, Jace was telepathically contacted by Ugin, who came to take Bolas to the [[Meditation Realm]] to prevent him from coming back to life on Ravnica. At Ugin's request, Jace used an illusion to hide the fact that Ugin had taken Bolas' body, concealing Ugin's presence from everyone and making them believe that Bolas' corpse had disintegrated instead. Jace then ordered [[Saheeli]] to disable the Immortal Sun (which had been reactivated as part of Gideon's plan to kill Bolas), allowing Ugin to planeswalk away with Bolas' body and allowing Liliana to escape certain death at the hands of the assembled Ravnicans.\n\nJace survived the battle and was present during the <c>Planewide Celebration</c> that followed, where he and Vraska finally shared a kiss.\n\n===Aftermath of the War===\nJace participated in the memorial service for Gideon on [[Theros (plane)|Theros]].<ref name=\"Forsaken\"/>\n\nAt some point after the War, while Tamiyo was still on Ravnica, Jace thought to ask about the vault that he had once seen on Thunder Junction. Tamiyo informed him that similar vaults existed on many planes, [[Coin Empire|relics of a lost empire]]. She also told him about the nature of what was contained within.\n\nBy command of the new Living Guildpact, who feared their interference, Jace and Chandra were kept out of the loop concerning the assignments of Vraska, Kaya, and Ral Zarek to pursue and kill Dovin Baan, Liliana, and Tezzeret respectively.<ref name=\"Forsaken\">[[Greg Weisman]] (November 2019). \"''[[War of the Spark: Forsaken]]''\".

Nissa abandoned Jace in her haste to pursue the lithomancer. Akiri was distrustful of the mythical \"walkers\" but decided to guide Jace to the Singing City anyway. In return, he pointed out the location of Kaza and Orah to her.\n\nDeep in the city, Jace found Nahiri, but both were overwhelmed by the city's unsettling and haunting music.<ref name=\"Haunted\"/> After Jace managed to save them by blocking out all sounds with a new spell, they came to an uneasy understanding. Jace began to comprehend Nahiri's vision of an orderly Zendikar with no roil and great prosperous cities. It reminded him of Ravnica and was beautiful to him. Nahiri explained that the old city had a magical focal point from where she could channel the Core's energy all over Zendikar through the [[leyline]]s. Jace promised to not hinder her in her endeavor to save Zendikar if she promised not to use the Core until they had studied its mechanism in more detail, perhaps on Ravnica. He knew that if he was ever going to unlock the mysteries of the Core, he was going to have to understand how it was activated. What if it was going to be a useful weapon in the battles to come, its mysterious power had to be quantified first.\n\nArriving at the focal point, they found that Nissa had located it earlier and had destroyed it with help from [[Ashaya]] and her other [[elemental]]s. He realized that Nissa felt betrayed.<ref name=\"Haunted\"/> She was angry that he had teamed up with Nahiri to research the Lithoform Core and he was unable to prevent the following all-out battle.<ref name=\"Haunted\"/> \n\nNissa and her Elementals attacked both Jace and Nahiri.<ref name=\"Two Guardians\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/episode-5-two-guardians-2020-09-30| Episode 5: The Two Guardians|[[A. T. Greenblatt]]|September 30, 2020}}</ref> Their force was so overwhelming that Jace and Nahiri had to retreat into the Singing City. Barricading the entrance, Nahiri began to collect power from the stones. When Jace tried to persuade her to flee to Ravnica with him, she refused. When she tried to remove him from the equation, Jace turned the tables on her and took control of her mind. Taking the Lithoform Core from Nahiri, he tried to find Nissa to tell her that he would take it to Ravnica to study it. Before he could make his argument, he was caught by Ashaya who took the Core and handed it to Nissa herself.\n\nAs Nissa held the Core she found that it was an ancient piece of Zendikar's soul that spoke to her, arguing that she could use it to restore Zendikar to power.<ref name=\"Two Guardians\"/> When Jace tried to take control of her mind, and Nahiri returned with a vengeance, Nissa used the power. Jace witnessed how she flattened the Singing City into dust and restored Zendikar's soil. With Nissa, Jace realized that the Core had served its purpose. It had undone damage to the plane. Zendikar was healing, turning into something healthier, stronger than it was before the battle with the Eldrazi. Though the scars were still there, they were memories now, not their defining features. \n\nNissa left, still feeling betrayed by Jace. He picked up the inert Core and watched Nissa disappear, hoping he could one day restore her trust in him.<ref name=\"Two Guardians\"/>\n\n===Fighting the Phyrexians===\n[[File:Phyrexian Arena ONE.jpg|thumb|238x238px|For a bittersweet moment, Jace believed he could still save his love.

Abandoning the group, he set out to find her. Because he carried the [[Sylex]], the complete group set out after him.\nFinding Vraska in [[Mephidross#The Dross Pist|Sheoldred's Coliseum]], the group found she was heavily wounded and already infected with [[Phyresis]]. Too late to save her, Jace chose to stay behind with her and relive their happy moments on Ravnica in his mind. Lingering too long, Vraska succumbed to the Phyrexian influence and infected Jace in turn. The others tried to escape but were quickly overwhelmed by the black Phyrexians. Nahiri, who was also infected, decided to sacrifice herself for the greater good. With a mighty magical blast, she exploded the Coliseum and dropped it with all remaining planeswalkers on the [[Fair Basilica]]. Nearer to their goal, the infected Jace rejoined them and volunteered to carry the [[Sylex]] to the [[Seedcore]].<ref name=\"Losses\" />\n\n===Compleation===\n[[File:Jace, the Perfected Mind.jpg|thumb|281x281px|[[Compleation|Compleated.]]]]\nJace's ''compleation'' progressed steadily, but he staunchly held on to his sanity as well as the Sylex. Evidence of his infection also became clearer. His right arm became fully mechanized, slight bits of metal grew on his face, and mechanical eyes attached to cables sprouted from his body.<ref name=\"Impossible\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/assault-on-new-phyrexia-or-episode-4-impossible-odds|Assault on New Phyrexia - Episode 4: Impossible Odds|[[Seanan McGuire]]|January 16, 2023}}</ref> Traveling through the [[Mycosynth Gardens]], the group reached the [[Seedcore]] and [[Realmbreaker]], just as it established its connection to other planes through the [[Blind Eternities]]. Jace prepared to activate the Sylex, but Kaya expressed concerns that the collateral damage of the Sylex blast had the potential to destroy one or more planes, or even the Eternities themselves.<ref name=\"Inevitable\"/> Jace acknowledged the possibility, but moved forward anyway, considering these planes the price for an un-''compleated'' Multiverse. Kaya and Kaito attacked him to interrupt the blast, but Jace evaded them with illusions. He ran his thumbnail across his forehead, dripping the ichor from the wound into the bowl. He also poured his grief, fury, suffering, and sorrow-drenched agony of all Mirrodin, regret for the Multiverse, and love for Vraska into the sylex. Although he believed the words to be unimportant, he spoke the bowl's inscription to complete the ritual.\n\nAs he was about to set off the Sylex, [[Elspeth Tirel|Elspeth]], who had been fighting the ''compleated'' [[Ajani Goldmane|Ajani]] to buy them time, burst into the chamber, impaled Jace with her Halo-infused blade, and seized the Sylex, planeswalking away.<ref name=\"Inevitable\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/assault-on-new-phyrexia-or-episode-5-inevitable-resolutions|Assault on New Phyrexia - Episode 5: Inevitable Resolution|[[Seanan McGuire]]|January 16, 2023}}</ref> The Halo gave Jace brief reprieve from the phyresis, but all he could do was form an illusion that he was mobile and aware instead of crippled by injury and struggled to defy the command of the glistening oil.<ref name=\"OTJ Epilogue 1\"/>\n\n===Uncompleation===\n[[File:JaceVraskaOTJ.jpg|thumb|left|Jace and Vraska recover from ''[[compleation]]''.]]\nLike the other planeswalkers, Jace was directed towards his home plane, his being Vryn.<ref name=\"OTJ Epilogue 1\"/> Jace could only develop a psychic defense against his ''compleated'' self's actions, while his body continued to act as a commander of the Phyrexian forces. They were defeated faster than the Ravnican invasion, and Jace was able to defy the oil. With a psychic command, he relayed to his body that he was sick, and mustered an immune defense against the Phyrexian conversion as he forcefully removed the physical components of his ''compleation''. Nonetheless, Jace was recognized from his childhood by the opposing general, and a warrant was served for his execution.<ref name=\"OTJ Epilogue 2\"/>\n\nJace planeswalked to Ravnica in the invasion's closing moments, finding a crippled Vraska struck by [[Ral Zarek]]'s haemalectric switch.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/one-and-the-same|''March of the Machine'' - Ravnica: One and the Same|[[Alison Lührs]]|March 24, 2023}}</ref><ref name=\"OTJ Epilogue 1\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/epilogue-1-the-invasion-tree|Outlaws of Thunder Junction - Epilogue 1: Bring the End, Part 1|[[Alison Lührs]]|April 1, 2024}}</ref> Without control of her physical body, Vraska could not communicate, so Jace delved into the pocket of her mind that he partitioned off after their time on Ixalan. Sure enough, Vraska was still there, and Jace could relay the psychic defense needed to shake the oil's grip. Running on fumes, Jace returned to the only haven left: the home of his mother, healer [[Ranna Beleren]].\n\n===Plotting the rebirth of the Multiverse===\nRanna was shocked, as she believed that Jace had been killed by whatever killed Alhammarret, but she managed to stabilize both Jace and Vraska physically.<ref name=\"OTJ Epilogue 2\"/> Although they were still visibly scarred by ''compleation'', they had control of both their bodies and minds. He told his mother about his life between Alhammarret's death and the Invasion, and Vraska told her about their relationship. During their healing process, the war concluded, followed by sweeping changes to the fabric of the Multiverse. Vraska and Jace were especially concerned to learn about [[Omenpath]]s, feeling certain that no good would come of them. They desired an end to the multiversal conflicts that had scarred them and [[Jace Beleren's attempt to fix the Multiverse|plotted a rebirth of the Multiverse]].\n\nJace recalled the existence of the vault on Thunder Junction and the creature inside and intuited that it could be helpful for their goal.<ref name=\"OTJ Epilogue 2\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/epilogue-2-bring-the-end-part-2|''Outlaws of Thunder Junction'' - Epilogue 2: Bring the End, Part 2|[[Alison Lührs]]|April 2, 2024}}</ref> However, their plan was thwarted when Vraska discovered that she [[Desparkening|had lost her planeswalker's spark]]. They recognized that they needed additional backup and changed their plans. Jace started on [[Eldraine]], where he disguised himself as [[Ashiok]] to fool the witch [[Eriette]] into working with them. Meanwhile, Vraska returned to Ixalan to recruit [[Malcolm Lee|Malcolm]] and [[Breeches]] from their old crew. Finally, Jace planeswalked to Ravnica and accessed the mind of the great detective [[Alquist Proft]] to better replicate his unique magic, which could project his psychic print into reality. He knocked Proft unconscious with a lead pipe, forced him to project his mental library, stole one of the files containing his knowledge, and returned him to the physical world before planeswalking away.\n\n===Thunder Junction===\n[[File:JaceOTJ2.jpg|thumb|Jace reveals his disguise.]]\nVraska and Jace traveled to Thunder Junction, now populated thanks to the Omenpaths. Jace disguised himself as Ashiok and hired [[Oko]] to find the vault key, promising him a share of the vault's treasure if he succeeded.<ref name=\"Jailbreak\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/episode-2-the-jailbreak|Outlaws Of Thunder Junction - Episode 2: The Jailbreak|[[Akemi Dawn Bowman]]|March 13, 2024}}</ref> Vraska joined the gang Oko put together, presumably to keep an eye on him. Oko was successfully able to locate the vault and get the key, but he was pursued by the [[Akul|Hellspurs]], a malevolent gang, as well as his son [[Kellan]] and Ral Zarek, whom he had provoked with his narcissistic behavior.<ref name=\"The Ballad\"/>\n\nJace, as Ashiok, met Oko at the vault and helped him secure the key from Kellan, who had almost taken it from him.<ref name=\"The Ballad\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/episode-6-the-ballad-of-thieves-and-thunderslingers|Episode 6: The Ballad of Thieves and Thunderslingers|[[Akemi Dawn Bowman]]|March 25, 2024}}</ref> He opened the vault and claimed his prize: within the vault was a creature called [[Loot]], who had been in stasis for millennia. One of Oko's gang members, [[Annie Flash]], saw through Jace's illusions with her magic sight, describing the scars and \"plugs\" on his body. However, before she was able to say more, Jace magically rendered her unconscious. Oko realized he had been tricked, and Vraska attempted to petrify him before he planeswalked away. Triggering the vault's collapse, Jace and Vraska disappeared with Loot.\n\n[[File:Loot.jpg|thumb|Jace and Vraska meet [[Loot]].]]\nJace and Vraska tested Loot's abilities in the wilderness of Thunder Junction, learning that he was able to visualize Omenpaths across the entire Multiverse.<ref name=\"OTJ Epilogue 2\"/> With his telepathy, Jace could access this information, and armed with Proft's magic, he could create an illusionary map. They celebrated in an inn that night and left the next morning. Their goal was to arrive on [[Tarkir]].<ref name=\"Wretched\" />\n\n=== Travels with Loot ===\nVraska, Jace, and Loot traveled to [[Bloomburrow (plane)|Bloomburrow]] on their way to Tarkir.<ref name=\"The Lost\"/> The plane's magic caused Jace to appear as a [[fox]]folk. Eventually, however, they were diverted from their course when Loot wandered through a mysterious door, which was a planar portal to [[Duskmourn]]. Jace and Vraska traveled there to get him back.<ref name=\"Wretched\" />\n\nJace wandered through [[the House]], his steps quiet and calculated, when he sensed someone nearby. His training had taught him to move almost silently, but as he approached, [[Kaito]] suddenly whirled and struck him square in the face. Shocked and bleeding, Jace stumbled back, recognizing Kaito, who was equally surprised to see him. Their last encounter had been on [[New Phyrexia]], where they had been on opposite sides, and tensions immediately flared. Despite the unresolved conflict between them, they quickly agreed to postpone their fight when an ominous groaning sound filled the room, signaling a new, more immediate threat.<ref name=\"Look\">{{ArticleArchive|magic-story/episode-three-dont-look-back|Duskmourn: House of Horror - Episode 3: Don't Look Back|[[Mira Grant]]|August 22, 2024}}</ref>\n\nIn the eerie, ever-shifting house, Kaito and Jace stood back-to-back as a grotesque, tentacled creature emerged from the walls, resembling a [[nightmare]] given form.<ref name=\"Give Up\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/episode-four-dont-give-up|Episode 4: Don't Give Up|Mira Grant|Aug 26, 2024}}</ref> Jace realized the creature was born from fear and, using his psychic abilities, reached into the minds within it to dispel the fear sustaining its existence. The creature dissipated, but tension remained between Jace and Kaito due to past betrayals. As they ventured deeper into the house, the floor gave way beneath them, trapping them in a pit of thick gel. Struggling to free themselves, they spotted a vision of [[Vraska]] and [[Loot]] in danger. Jace, prioritizing the others, climbed out, abandoning Kaito. As the gel threatened to consume him, Kaito, feeling betrayed, [[planeswalk]]ed back to [[Ravnica]]. Although Jace was able to rescue Vraska, they could not recover Loot and he was captured by the demon [[Valgavoth]], who desired to exploit his power and gain the [[Aetherspark]].<ref name=\"Don't Die\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/episode-six-dont-die|''Duskmourn: House of Horror'' Episode 6 - Don't Die|[[Mira Grant]]|August 30, 2024}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Loot and [[Winter]] to [[Avishkar]], Vraska and Jace broke into the home of [[Mohar Varma]] and asked him for help.<ref name=\"Pit Stop\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/aetherdrift-episode-2-pit-stop|''Aetherdrift'' Episode 2: Pit Stop|[[K.

However, it had reached its final stages and he would not be deterred.\n\n===Meditation Realm===\nWith the help of Loot's mind map, Jace and Vraska traveled through an Omenpath to the [[Meditation Plane]], where they were met by [[Narset]] and [[Elspeth Tirel]].<ref name=\"Recursion\"/><ref name=\"Wretched\"/> At first, the Realm looked different for each of them, as their thoughts were what trapped them in a shifting space. Jace saw no logic, no actual roads, and feared they would be trapped forever.<ref name=\"Wretched\"/> However, Narset realized that the plane was adapting to their thoughts and used a meditative technique to empty her mind, allowing the plane to assume its true form. To their shock, they were met by the two elder dragons that had been sealed away here in eternal lockdown. While [[Ugin]] berated Jace for breaking their agreement and warned them to get away, the nameless dragon that had been [[Nicol Bolas]] saw a chance to gain information and regain power.\n\nWhile all the others were distracted, Jace put his plan into motion. He secretly moved behind Ugin's back and stole his [[Spirit-Gem]]. Using the power of the Gem, he started casting a magnificent spell, making use of Proft's technique to manifest an illusion into reality with the multiversal reality-bending properties of the Realm. Thinking that he would offer the Gem to Bolas, Elspeth attacked and temporarily distracted him. While even Vraska tried to hold him back at the last minute, he proceeded anyway. The world blurred and deepened in hue, becoming the blue of the mind mage's magic. Briefly, it appeared as if Jace might have done the impossible. The Realm expanded like an animal drawing its first breath, and when it exhaled, visions became kaleidoscopic, filled then with the glimpses of the futures that they'd lost: dead friends alive again, worlds unbroken, planes made innocent of their pain. Obedient to its new master, the Meditation Realm attempted to recreate itself in the image of Jace's desperate hopes, but for all the power he'd thieved from Ugin's gem, Jace was still only human. He gasped, the last of his endurance failing, and the others stared in horror as the horizon broke into mirrored fragments, revealing a nothingness that ate at the eye, a void that poured toward them, unmaking reality — Jace included. As the emptiness rolled over him, he shattered like glass.<ref name=\"Wretched\"/>\n\nTo escape the catastrophe, all present, including Bolas, left the Meditation Realm. Later, a reflected silhouette of a mage in a blue cloak manifested in the waters of the Realm, similar to how a reflection of Ugin had manifested there when he was [[Ugin#Confrontation on the Meditation Plane|reborn from the Realm's waters]] after his death at the hands of Bolas.<ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/tarkir-dragonstorm-episode-7-return|Tarkir: Dragonstorm - Episode 7: Return|[[Cassandra Khaw]]|March 17, 2025}}</ref>\n\n==Artifacts acquired==\n*<c>The Filigree Sylex</c>, created by [[Saheeli Rai]] on [[Dominaria (plane)|Dominaria]] and activated in the core of [[New Phyrexia (plane)|New Phyrexia]].\n*<c>Lead Pipe</c>, used to incapacitate [[Alquist Proft]] to discern the nature of Proft's magic, and the differences between it and Jace's\n\n==In other media==\n===Boom! comics===\n{{Boom!}}\n\n====Frozen Heart====\nAfter the Hall of the Hospitallers of the Frozen Heart raided [[Duskmantle]]<ref name=\"Magic 4\">MacKay, Jed.

With that, these departures have been placed in trivia rather than the main article. {{-}} Possessing all of Tezzeret's knowledge about the artificer's life, Jace set a series of traps to try and locate him should he have survived Kamigawa. When Tezzeret stumbled into such a trap upon Esper, Jace was alerted and went there to try and deal with him. Tezzeret got the upper hand, infecting Jace with an etherium device that prevented him from using any of his abilities, but the device was removed by Nicol Bolas later, as part of Tezzeret's plans. Once again free, the artificer and the telepath immediately rekindled their war. Bolas intervened again, unbeknownst to Jace, and sent Tezzeret to [[Mirrodin (plane)|Mirrodin]].\n*The proprietary font that's been used from ''[[Magic 2015]]'' onward is called Beleren, after Jace.<ref>{{WebRef|url=https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/daily-deck/directors-chair-2013-2013-12-19|title=From the Director's Chair: 2013|author=[[Aaron Forsythe]]|date=January 06, 2014|work=[[magicthegathering.com]]|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20210429054029/https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/daily-deck/directors-chair-2013-2013-12-19|archivedate=2021-04-29}}</ref><ref>{{DailyRef|making-magic/25-more-random-things-about-magic-2016-06-20|25 More Random Things About Magic|[[Mark Rosewater]]|June 20, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{WebRef|url=https://delve.tumblr.com/post/108195911234/creation-of-the-beleren-typeface|title=Creation of the Beleren Typeface|date=2016|publisher=Delve.tumblr.com}}</ref>\n*[http://duelmasters.wikia.com/wiki/Jace,_the_Mind_Sculptor Jace, the Mind Sculptor] is also featured as a card in the Japanese [[TCG]] ''[[Duel Masters]]'', which is published by [[Wizards of the Coast]] as well.<ref>{{EzTumblr|http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/138359327673/i-recently-learned-about-jace-and-nicol-bolas|title=I recently learned about Jace and Nicol Bolas cards being released for Duel Masters in Japan.|January 30, 2016}}</ref>\n*R&D videos for Jace Vryn's Prodigy / Jace Telepath Unbound refer to Jace as the most powerful planeswalker in the ''Magic Origins'' set.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwuU7yG7lWc Magic: The Gathering - Inside R&D Magic Origins: Jace]</ref>\n*In the video game ''[[Magic: The Gathering Arena]]'', Jace is voiced by [[Wikipedia:Nolan North|Nolan North]].<ref>{{WebRef|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10967214/characters/nm0636046|title=Nolan North as Jace Beleren|publisher=IMDB}}</ref>\n*In contrast to the other compleated planeswalkers and creatures that exhibit characteristics of the color that compleated them, Jace exhibits the physical characteristic of the Phyrexians of his natural color (the Chrome Host's optical tendrils) despite being infected by a member of the Etched Host, Vraska.

He has long brown hair streaked through with gray, his wrists wrapped in leather cuffs. He is strong, hulking even, and carries a sword that was meant for two in one hand. It can pulse with flame. On his right cheek just below his eye is the [[Mark of the Elder Druid]].<ref name=\"Ulf\"/> Jared is a formidable [[warrior]], swordsman, and mage. He can channel his magic into his sword during his strikes. \n\nJared has access to the five [[mana]] colors.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Jared Carthalion, True Heir.jpg|left|thumb|267x267px|Jared with [[Foecleaver]] before his ascension as a [[Planeswalker (lore)|planeswalker]].]]\n\n===Youth===\nJared's father, [[Adam Carthalion]], wanted to save [[Dominaria (plane)|Dominaria]] from a terrible danger that had been foretold. In pursuit of this, [[Ravidel]] talked Adam into a quest to become a planeswalker. He even sacrificed his wife, [[Gwendolyn Carthalion]], to Ravidel to achieve this, not knowing that Ravidel was the danger he wanted to destroy. Finally, when Ravidel asked Adam to sacrifice Jared, he refused and battled the planeswalker. Jared was hit by a <c>syphon soul</c> in this battle, and his appearance was altered so that nobody recognized him as the rightful heir of the [[Carthalion]] line.\n\nJared grew up a beggar on the streets of [[Arathoxia]], brought up by his father's spellsquire [[Ezer]]. \n\n===Revenge===\nSixteen years later Ravidel tracked Jared down and conquered Arathoxia. Jared [[summon]]ed [[Eusomoné]] to fight off Ravidel's giant [[spider]]; when Ezer grew sick, he met the [[Mistress of House Scarlet]] who gave him a potion to save Ezer and showed him the [[Black Lotus]]. Jared stole the Lotus and met [[Liana of Minorad]], who later saved him from Ravidel. Jared led [[Yorgo]] and other refugees from Arathoxia against Ravidel at [[Castle Melmereth]], using a [[Fellwar Stone]] and a magic scroll to get inside. Using the Black Lotus, he summoned a [[Shivan Dragon]], which appeared to kill Ravidel and destroy Castle Melmereth.\n[[File:Kristina and Jared.png|thumb|320x320px|Kristina and Jared]]\n\n===Wayfarer===\nHe left Liana to become a Wayfarer. After having trouble in [[Hamath]] with [[Visionary Kadesha]] and [[Élan d'Avenant]], he was taken by [[Kristina of the Woods]], who began to teach him to use all aspects of mana. They eventually fell in love, soon after his sixteenth birthday.\n\n===Confrontation and ascension===\nJared and Kristina learned from the [[Great Spirit]] in the [[White Woods]] that Ravidel was alive, and they moved to oppose him. Jared watched as Ravidel and Liana dueled, and accidentally summoned Élan into the battle, resulting in Liana's death. He escaped with the [[Moxes]] and Kristina on the Shivan Dragon. He headed for [[Corundis]], where he found the two [[long-daggers]] that he would use to destroy the [[Golgothian Sylex]] with the help of his maternal grandfather [[Grenfell Mor]] and [[Altair of Coloni]]. What is worse, Ravidel took Liana's [[Moxen]] and [[Activation of the Mox Beacon|activated]] the [[Mox Beacon]] that would start the [[Planeswalker War]].<ref name=\"CMR\">{{DailyRef|card-preview/legendary-characters-commander-legends-part-2-2020-11-06|The Legendary Characters of Commander Legends, Part 2|[[Ari Zirulnik]] and [[Ethan Fleischer]]|November 06, 2020}}</ref> \n\nWith the aid of Altair of Coloni, [[Caliphear the Nightmare]], and Kristina, Jared battled Ravidel at the [[Dueling Chasm of Golthonor]]. During the battle, he could draw on all five colors of mana, having been taught by Kristina and his other companions the other forms of magic. Ravidel set off the Mox Beacon and disappeared in the chaos of the crumbling monoliths of the chasm; Jared ascended and [[Igniting|became a planeswalker]] in time to planeswalk away from the crumbling monoliths and save Kristina from falling or being crushed, though Altair was killed. A year and a half later, Jared and Kristina had a daughter together and named her [[List of secondary characters/Dominaria|Justina Carthalion]].<ref>[[Prelude to War]]</ref>\n\n===Great Mending===\nJared was likely affected by the [[Great Mending]] of 4500 [[AR]] in the same way as all other planeswalkers, losing his immortality and godlike powers and returning to normal aging.\n\n===Dominaria United===\n[[File:Dominaria United Commander Deck Promo Art - Legends Legacy Geyadrone Dihada and Painbow Jared Carthalion.jpg|left|thumb|360x360px|Present [[Geyadrone Dihada|Dihada]] and Jared]]\nAn old man, the ancient former planeswalker still wields his trusty sword [[Foecleaver]] in defense of the innocent.<ref name=\"Visual\">[[Jay Annelli]] (2022), \"''[[Magic: The Gathering - The Visual Guide]]''\", DK</ref> Jared returned to Dominaria during the second [[Phyrexian]] invasion of Dominaria, joining with the [[The Coalition|New Coalition]] to protect his homeland.<ref name=\"DMU Legends\">{{DailyRef|feature/legends-youll-find-dominaria-united-2022-09-01|The Legends You'll Find in Dominaria United|[[Roy Graham]]|September 1, 2022}}</ref> He appeared at the [[Tolarian Academy]] of [[Lat-Nam]], defending the student [[Ulf]] against the [[sleeper agent]]s.

She had dark eyebrows and a long flag of red-brown hair spilling down her shoulders.<ref name=\"Eternal Ice\"/>\n\nIn later years, she resurfaced as an elderly woman with steel-grey hair. Although a pyromancer, she was rather thoughtful and controlled, utilizing her flames with a clear head, making her a direct contrast to her former student, Chandra, to whom she was teaching control. She was quite witty, still making sarcastic remarks about foes who found themselves on the receiving end of her flames. Jaya later learned how to use lightning magic in addition to her pyromancy.\n\nJaya's center was in [[red]] mana. As she planeswalked, she disappeared in a conflagration of flame. She sometimes reappeared with a flash and the smell of charcoal.<ref name=\"Hourglass\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/episode-2-sand-hourglass-2022-08-11|Sand in the Hourglass|[[Langley Hyde]]|August 11, 2022}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early life===\n[[File:Jaya.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|Jaya before her ascension]]\nJaya's childhood is shrouded in mystery, but she learned to be a thief on the streets. One day, she tried to steal something from the private chambers of Archmage Eternal [[Jodah]] but was unsuccessful. Sensing magical capabilities in her, Jodah allowed Jaya to study in the [[School of the Unseen]] at [[Lat-Nam]], but after learning a few spells she decided to set out into the world and make a living as a task mage. During her travels, Jaya helped [[Kolbjörn]] and received an amulet capable of summoning Freyalise. She also was instrumental in defending a [[Kjeldor]]an village from a <c>lhurgoyf</c>.<ref name=\"Eternal Ice\">[[Jeff Grubb]] (2000), ''\"[[The Eternal Ice]]\"'', [[Wizards of the Coast]]</ref>\n\n===Eternal Ice<ref name=\"Eternal Ice\"/>===\nWhen Jaya showed up at the [[School of the Unseen]] in [[Lat-Nam]] and found [[Jodah]] missing. No one seemed to know where he went, and a few seemed purposely not to care. She started looking and found someone who knew someone who knew something. Eventually, the trail led to [[Tresserhorn]].\n\nJaya traveled to that dark keep and found Jodah there. He had been drugged with <c>Fyndhorn pollen</c> by [[Lim-Dûl]] and made to think he was a summoned creature. She destroyed the pollen-bearing flower and rescued him, but Jodah started becoming mad from his ancient memories resurfacing. Combined with withdrawal from the lack of pollen, this caused him to collapse with feverish rambling. Jaya summoned [[Freyalise]], but the planeswalker wanted something in return for her aid: to use Jodah's mirror and the resources of the School of the Unseen to prepare for her [[World Spell]]. Although Jaya was in no position to offer her these tokens, she agreed on Jodah's behalf nonetheless.\n\nJaya was instrumental in Jodah's plans to prepare Kjeldor for the upcoming invasion by Lim-Dûl and the alliance between Kjeldor and Balduvia. During [[Lim-Dûl's Battle]], his final assault on Kjeldor, Jaya fought against [[Chaeska]], Lim-Dûl's right hand. Though he was warded against her red spell, Jaya tapped into blue mana and cast <c>unsummon</c> on the Keeper, returning him directly to Tresserhorn. Jaya was successful in her battle and later claimed Lim-Dûl's severed hand as a battle trophy, not knowing that it still bore [[Mairsil]]'s ring. This ring would over the next decade make her a slave to Mairsil's will.\n\n===Shattered Alliance===\nDuring the next twenty years, Jaya was the leader of a group of mages who tried to protect the city of [[Kelsinko]] from being flooded by the rising seas without success.[[File:Jaya’s-Immolating-Inferno.jpg|thumb|240x240px|The moment when Jaya ignites her spark|alt=|left]]\n\nTwenty years after the casting of World Spell, Jaya suddenly appeared in the School of the Unseen to see Jodah, who she had not seen since Lim-Dûl's assault. She brought Jodah an emaciated, blackened hand of Lim-Dûl with one of its fingers removed. The finger with the ruby ring - [[Mairsil]]'s ring - was missing. Jodah and Jaya set out to search for the missing ring, fearing that Jodah's ancient enemy had returned.\n\nTheir journey leads them to [[Tresserhorn]], [[Kjeld]], [[Lovisa Coldeyes]]'s Balduvian camp, and finally to [[Soldev]]. During the journey, Jodah realized that Jaya had somewhat changed since her younger years, and she often behaved strangely. When they reached Soldev and visited the vaults of the Adnates, the truth was revealed: in the aftermath of Lim-Dûl's battle against Kjeldor and Balduvia, Jaya found the finger and the ring and decided to bring them to Jodah, hoping that they would help him.\n\nHowever, she donned the ruby ring, and Mairsil the Pretender's spirit infected her mind. She cut Jodah's throat, using his blood to revive the Phyrexian war beasts. Jodah miraculously saved himself from certain death with the help of his mirror. He then battled the possessed Jaya in the debris of ruined Soldev. He managed to shatter his mirror directly into her face, triggering the \"reward\" from Freyalise. In the blazing inferno that followed this breakpoint Jaya's planeswalker spark flared. With a thought, she erased Mairsil's tainted presence once and for all, then planeswalked to the School of the Unseen and destroyed the rampaging war beasts there. With Jodah's help, she cut and sealed the bottomless pit that Lim-Dûl relocated there from Tresserhorn with the agreement of [[Gerda Äagesdotter]]. Finally, she helped Gerda with finding a new location for the school.\n\nAs a parting gift, Jaya gave Jodah an amulet, allowing him to remain sane despite his age, and allowing him to live as long as he willed to. She then departed Dominaria for the wider [[multiverse]].\n\n===Presumed death===\nJodah later stated that Jaya had died in the period between the end of the Ice Age and the Mending, the cause being her recklessness and impetuousness, which \"eventually cost her her life.\" There is some speculation that the Jodah who said this came from an alternate reality and thus was referring to \"another\" Jaya.\n[[File:Jaya Old.png|alt=|thumb|285x285px|Jaya in her latter days.]]\n\n===Regatha===\nBefore the [[Great Mending|Mending]], Jaya visited the plane of [[Regatha]], imparting her wisdom and performing pyromancy. Returning two hundred years later, and having aged for nearly sixty years, she found that religion had sprung up based around her teachings, and chose to stay and nurture the community, posing as the elder '''Mother Luti''', the matriarch of [[Keral Keep]]. A few years after Jaya's return, [[Chandra Nalaar]] arrived on the plane and began studying under her and the abbot [[Serenok]].<ref>{{WebRef|url=http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/uncharted-realms/offers-fire-2015-08-05|title=Offers to the Fire|author=[[Doug Beyer]]|date=August 5, 2015|work=[[magicthegathering.com]]|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150808105848/http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/uncharted-realms/offers-fire-2015-08-05|archivedate=2015-08-08}}</ref><ref>{{WebRef|url=http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/uncharted-realms/promises-keep-2015-12-02|title=Promises to Keep|author=[[Doug Beyer]]|date=December 2, 2015|work=[[magicthegathering.com]]|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202172804/http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/uncharted-realms/promises-keep-2015-12-02|archivedate=2015-12-02}}</ref><ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/return-dominaria-episode-8-2018-05-02|Return to Dominaria: Episode 8|[[Martha Wells]]|May 2, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{DailyRef|magic-story/return-dominaria-episode-9-2018-05-09|Return to Dominaria: Episode 9|[[Martha Wells]]|May 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Meeting the Gatewatch===\nWhen [[Jace Beleren]] traveled to Dominaria to meet his friends of the [[Gatewatch]], he found [[Gideon]] traveling on a skyship with the old pyromancer.<ref name=\"Wool\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/wool-over-eyes-2018-02-14|Wool over the Eyes|[[R&D Narrative Team]]|February 14, 2018}}</ref>  After she helped defeat [[Belzenlok]], Jaya agreed to help the [[Gatewatch]] in the fight against [[Nicol Bolas]].

Del Rey.</ref>\n\nDuring the invasion, the trapped planeswalkers got together with Ravnican leaders to strategize. At Jace's recommendation, they decided to split up into teams to focus on specific tasks. Jace, Jaya, Teferi, and [[Vivien]] volunteered to assassinate Liliana. When they found her, Teferi warped time around her, slowing her ability to react, defend herself, or strike back at her attackers. This allowed Jaya and Vivien to badly wound her with fire, arrows, and animal spirits, although the [[Onakke]] spirits in Liliana's [[Chain Veil]] protected her. Nonetheless, they almost succeeded, but Bolas stepped in and saved Liliana by destroying the buildings they were standing on. Fortunately, Teferi saved himself and the other three planeswalkers by slowing their falls.\n\nJaya survived the battle and was present during the <c>Planewide Celebration</c> that followed. At the behest of [[Samut]], she and Chandra cremated the bodies of the now-inactive Eternals.\n\n===Forsaken===\nTo protect [[Chandra]] from more grief in a confrontation with her former friend [[Liliana]], Jaya secretly tracked Liliana to [[Dominaria (plane)|Dominaria]] and agreed to escort [[Kaya]], [[Teyo]] and [[Araithia Shokta|Rat]] to the necromancer's [[Caligo|exact location]].<ref name=\"Forsaken\">[[Greg Weisman]] (November 2019). \"''[[War of the Spark: Forsaken]]''\".

To make sure that her message and portrayal would not be misinterpreted and distorted, Jaya kept a close eye on Keral Keep under the guise of Mother Luti.\n\nAfter her death, Jaya was memorialized on Shiv with four white pyramids, each containing the memories of those close to her, and an ever-burning flame.<ref name=\"Whisper\"/>\n\n==Trivia==\n*Jaya Ballard was created by [[John Tynes]], who wrote the [[flavor text]] for ''[[Ice Age]]''.<ref>{{TwitterRef|JohnScottTynes|1551066489997762560|author=John Scott Tynes|title=I wrote the flavor text for Ice Age|date=July 24, 2022}}</ref>\n*In [[prerevisionist]] storylines, Jaya was little more than a supporting character in the Ice Age, who accompanied [[Kaysa]], [[Jaeuhl Carthalion]], [[Laina]], [[Taaveti]], the [[Elf#Fyndhorn Elves|Fyndhorn elves]] and some [[Knights of Kjeldor]] into [[Yavimaya]] as their guide and hired protector a decade after Freyalise cast her World Spell.

He renamed himself Yanggu (literally \"valley where sun rises\"<ref name=\"insert\">About the Global Series. Insert. 400C5446000001 EN.</ref>) after the Easternmost Valley of his home country.<ref>{{WebRef|url=https://www.bilibili.com/video/av24221434|title=Global Series: Jiang Yanggu & Mu Yanling Video Trailer|publisher=bilibili}}</ref><ref>{{PWBio|Jiang-Yanggu|accessdate=July 2018}}</ref> To save the Jiuli Clan, which was haunted by plague, Yanggu ventured into the Ten Wizards Mountain for a solution. Here he battled, and later befriended, the mysterious water mage [[Mu Yanling]]. With Yanling's help, Yanggu tackled the threat of the plague. In order to find out who he really was, he went onto the journey of expedition with Mu Yanling.\n[[File:Giant-Growth-Jiang Yanggu War-of-the-Spark.jpg|thumb|Mowu Growth|261x261px]]\n\n===War of the Spark===\nJiang Yanggu and Mu Yanling were lured to [[Ravnica]] by the [[Interplanar Beacon]], and immediately became trapped there due to [[Bolas]]'s use of the [[Immortal Sun]]. Alongside many other planeswalkers and Ravnicans, he [[War of the Spark (event)|fought]] against the [[Eternal]]s of Bolas' [[Dreadhorde]].<ref name=\"Weisman Ravnica novel\">[[Greg Weisman]] (April 2019). \"''[[War of the Spark: Ravnica]]''\". Del Rey.</ref>\n\nDuring the invasion, the trapped planeswalkers got together with Ravnican leaders to strategize. At [[Jace]]'s recommendation, they decided to split up into teams to focus on specific tasks. [[Ajani]], [[Huatli]], Jiang Yanggu, and Mu Yanling volunteered to help protect and rescue civilians. With the help of [[Vraska]] and the [[Golgari Swarm]], they were able to evacuate many civilians to the tunnels beneath the city, where they would be safe from the Dreadhorde.\n\nYanggu was one of the few planeswalkers who chose to remain on Ravnica after Chandra disabled the Immortal Sun, helping the Gatewatch in their fight against Bolas. He and Yanling survived the battle, and they were among the first planeswalkers to leave Ravnica after Bolas' defeat, with Mowu turning into a stone statue before both he and Yanggu disappeared.\n\n==Trivia==\n*In the ''D&D'' campaign released with ''[[Dungeons & Dragons: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms]]'', Yanggu was given a character sheet representing him as a druid, a spellcaster attuned with nature and animals. His sheet includes Mowu as a \"mastiff\", although it does not include any statistics or special abilities for the dog. Their alignment is Neutral Good, indicating generally heroic natures. His spells and abilities include a heavy focus on animal friendship, although none that specifically replicate the canonical character's unique connection to Mowu.

Kaito's planeswalker spark ignited when he came into contact with the kami, who now lives in Tameshi's robot. Tameshi and the nascent planeswalker became best friends, and worked together as mentor and pupil under the Futurists for nine years until Kaito learned that his friend had betrayed both him and their organization to work for the [[Phyrexian]] [[praetor]] [[Jin-Gitaxias]].<ref name=\"Lies\"/> After reuniting with [[the Wanderer]] on Kamigawa, he and the [[moonfolk]] Planeswalker [[Tamiyo]] fought Jin-Gitaxias and [[Tezzeret]] to keep the returned emperor and their plane safe.

Abandoning the group, he set out to find her. Because he carried the [[Sylex]], the complete group set out after him.\n\nFinding Vraska in [[Mephidross#The Dross Pist|Sheoldred's Coliseum]], they found she was heavily wounded and already infected with [[Phyresis]]. Too late to save her, Jace chose to stay behind with her and relive their happy moments on Ravnica in his mind. Lingering too long, Vraska succumbed to the Phyrexian influence and infected Jace in turn. The others tried to escape but were quickly overwhelmed by the black Phyrexians. [[Nahiri]], who was also infected, decided to sacrifice herself for the greater good. With a mighty magical blast, she exploded the Coliseum and dropped it with all remaining planeswalkers on the [[Fair Basilica]]. Nearer to their goal, the infected Jace rejoined them and volunteered to activate the [[Sylex]].<ref name=\"Losses\"/>\n\nTraveling through the [[Mycosynth Gardens]], Kaito, Kaya, and Jace reached the [[Seedcore]] just as [[Realmbreaker]] established its connection to other planes through the [[Blind Eternities]].<ref name=\"Impossible\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/assault-on-new-phyrexia-or-episode-4-impossible-odds|Assault on New Phyrexia - Episode 4: Impossible Odds|[[Seanan McGuire]]|January 16, 2023}}</ref> Jace prepared to activate the Sylex, but Kaya expressed concerns that the collateral damage of the Sylex blast had the potential to destroy one or more planes, or even the Eternities themselves.<ref name=\"Inevitable\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/assault-on-new-phyrexia-or-episode-5-inevitable-resolutions|Assault on New Phyrexia - Episode 5: Inevitable Resolution|[[Seanan McGuire]]|January 16, 2023}}</ref> Jace acknowledged the possibility, but moved forward anyway, considering these planes the price for an un-''compleated'' Multiverse.

Just as Jace began to activate the sylex, [[Elspeth Tirel|Elspeth]], who had been fighting the ''compleated'' [[Ajani Goldmane|Ajani]] to buy them time, burst into the chamber, impaled Jace with her halo-infused blade, and seized the Sylex, planeswalking away.\n\nKaito was left alone with Kaya and Tyvar, the three of them watching Phyrexian armies march to invade other worlds. Suddenly, [[Elesh Norn]] entered the chamber alongside Tamiyo and the newly ''compleated'' Nahiri and Nissa. Norn animated Jace's now-fully ''compleated'' body, causing Luxior to fall out of it. Kaito swiftly grabbed the sword. Then, she invited the three to yield to the glory of Phyrexia.

As he was doing so, he met with the Wanderer, who told him that [[Nashi]], Tamiyo's adopted son, had disappeared, with the only clue to his whereabouts being mysterious footage of a strange door that he had captured before his disappearance. They resolved to rescue him.<ref name=\"DSK Legends\">{{DailyRef|feature/the-legends-of-duskmourn-house-of-horror|The Legends of Duskmourn: House of Horror|[[Emily Teng]]|September 19, 2024}}</ref>\n\nKaito traveled to [[Kaldheim (plane)|Kaldheim]] to recruit Tyvar to the team, and the prince insisted that [[Niko Aris]] come along.<ref name=\"Dark House\" /> They traveled to [[Ravnica]] through an [[Omenpath]], where the strange door had reappeared. [[Niv-Mizzet]], in hopes of studying what lay on the other side, had recruited other specialists to the rescue team, including [[Zimone Wola]] and [[Aminatou]]; however, the latter refused to enter the door, instead providing the team with magical fateshifter tokens that would allow them to see visions of the future when they made a decision that would result in their death. Armed with this backup, Kaito, Tyvar, Niko, Zimone, and the Wanderer entered the door, transporting themselves to [[Duskmourn]].\n\nKaito was separated from his companions when a trap caused the floor beneath him to open.<ref name=\"Split\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/episode-two-dont-split-the-party|''Duskmourn: House of Horror'' - Episode 2: Don't Split the Party|[[Mira Grant]]|August 20, 2024}}</ref> Despite his training and swift reflexes, he fell into the darkness below, his sword barely slipping from his grasp as he descended. The floor above was sealed shut behind him, leaving him isolated and alone in the eerie, disorienting space of the House. His fall disrupted the group’s plans, forcing them to regroup and attempt to find him while dealing with the dangers of the labyrinthine structure.\n\nKaito fell silently through the darkness, maintaining his calm despite the long descent. [[Himoto]] clung to his shoulder, offering him a sense of comfort. When he finally landed, he was on a forest floor, surprisingly uninjured despite the fall. The eerie, decaying [[forest]] around him reeked of wet loam, and as he surveyed his surroundings, a [[dragon]] appeared, setting the trees ablaze. Kaito attempted to escape, but the dragon's fire engulfed him. Suddenly, he found himself in a different setting — a barren, ashen plain beneath a sky filled with more dragons, torching a city. The scene then shifted again, leaving Kaito in an underground room where he encountered [[Jace]], whom he struck instinctively. After a brief, tense exchange, they were forced to put aside their differences as the room groaned ominously, signaling a new threat.<ref name=\"Look\">{{ArticleArchive|magic-story/episode-three-dont-look-back|Duskmourn: House of Horror - Episode 3: Don't Look Back|[[Mira Grant]]|August 22, 2024}}</ref>\n\nIn the eerie, ever-shifting house, Kaito and Jace stood back-to-back as a grotesque, tentacled creature emerged from the walls, a [[nightmare]] given form.<ref name=\"Give Up\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/episode-four-dont-give-up|Episode 4: Don't Give Up|Mira Grant|Aug 26 2024}}</ref> Jace realized the creature was born from fear and, using his psychic abilities, reached into the minds within it to dispel the fear sustaining its existence. The creature dissipated, but tension remained between Jace and Kaito due to past betrayals. As they ventured deeper into the house, the floor gave way beneath them, trapping them in a pit of thick gel. Struggling to free themselves, they spotted a vision of [[Vraska]] and [[Loot]] in danger. Jace, prioritizing the others, climbed out, abandoning Kaito. As the gel threatened to consume him, Kaito, feeling betrayed, [[planeswalk]]ed back to [[Ravnica]].\n\nKaito found himself back in Ravnica in the alley where he had first met Zimone, overwhelmed by the city's noise after the eerie silence of Duskmourn.<ref name=\"Give in\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/episode-five-dont-give-in|Duskmourn: House of Horror - Episode 5: Don't Give In|[[Mira Grant]]|2024-08-28}}</ref> He realized he was holding a bloodstained piece of wood from Duskmourn and tried to Planeswalk to return to the House, but nothing happened, causing him to panic. Fearful that his spark might have failed, Kaito rushed to find Niv-Mizzet and the others at their camp. Niv-Mizzet stopped him and questioned what had happened, prompting Kaito to explain that Jace had left him behind. Aminatou reassured Kaito that his spark was still intact and suggested that the House itself had rejected him. [[Proft]] then suggested he had an idea that might help, and Kaito, lacking other options, followed him to the workstations, aware that time was running out.\n\nProft successfully created an artificial Omenpath to Duskmourn by using his mind magic in combination with Kaito’s spark, Aminatou’s abilities, and a piece of wood from [[the House]] that Kaito had provided.<ref name=\"Don't Die\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/episode-six-dont-die|''Duskmourn: House of Horror'' Episode 6 - Don't Die|[[Mira Grant]]|August 30, 2024}}</ref> Kaito and Proft then rescued Nashi, the Wanderer, Tyvar, Zimone, and Niko from the grasp of [[Valgavoth]].

Disgusted by this act of kinslaying, she ended her battle and led Emilio back into the house under the pretense that the specter had been slain. Once the nobleman had been lured inside, Kaya revealed that she knew the extent of his crimes and left him to the wrath of his slain mother. With the Revari contract settled, she could now attend to a much larger payday.<ref name=\":0\" /> Her next job came through a contract from [[Marchesa]] to assassinate the ghostly King [[Brago]]. Utilizing her incorporeal powers, she successfully infiltrated Brago's dining room and plunged her rondel dagger into his spectral neck.

After several swings of Adriana's sword passed through Kaya's unharmed body, the ghost assassin retaliated with an elbow to the jaw.

Once the Beacon was active, Bolas brought the Immortal Sun to Ravnica, trapping the planeswalkers there. Having become aware of Bolas' treacherous nature, Kaya defected from him for good.\n\nBolas' invasion began shortly after that, and the [[Eternal]]s of the [[Dreadhorde]] marched forth from the dragon's [[Planar Bridge]]. She befriended [[Teyo Verada]], a [[Igniting|newly-ignited]] planeswalker who had just arrived on Ravnica.<ref name=\"Old Friends\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/war-spark-ravnica-old-friends-and-new-2019-05-08|War of the Spark — Old Friends and New|[[Greg Weisman]]|May 8, 2019}}</ref> With the help of a [[Gateless]] street urchin named [[Araithia Shokta]] (nicknamed Rat), Kaya and Ral helped explain the situation to Teyo.

She faced resistance from them, but the Syndicate's chief enforcer – the giant [[Bilagru]] – convinced them that Bolas posed an existential threat to all of Ravnica and, by extension, to the Syndicate's economic interests. (Unbeknownst to Kaya, Bilagru had been persuaded to help her by an Orzhov representative [[Tomik Vrona]].)

At [[Jace]]'s recommendation, they decided to split up into teams to focus on specific tasks. Kaya, Teyo, and Araithia were sent to persuade the guilds that remained neutral (Selesnya, Gruul, Golgari, and Rakdos) to join the fight against Bolas.<ref name=\"Operatives\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/war-spark-ravnica-desperate-operatives-2019-05-29|War of the Spark: Ravnica – Desperate Operatives|[[Greg Weisman]]|May 29, 2019}}</ref> They received an audience [[Emmara Tandris]], acting guildmaster of the [[Selesnya Conclave]], who initially refused their plea for help. However, her decision was overruled when [[Trostani]] awakened and ruled in favor of helping the Gatewatch. The group then went to speak with [[Borborygmos]] of the [[Gruul Clans]], and Araithia convinced the cyclops to support their cause.[[File:Kaya's Ghostform 2.jpg|thumb|<c>Kaya's Ghostform</c>|243x243px|alt=]]\n\nThey were joined by Ral, who accompanied them to the [[Undercity]]. In [[Vraska]]'s absence, the other leaders of the [[Golgari Swarm]] squabbled for control of her throne, but Vraska returned and united them. Despite Ral and Kaya's suspicion of the [[gorgon]], Vraska pledged the Golgari to the fight against Bolas. With the help of [[Ajani]] and his team of planeswalkers, they were able to evacuate many civilians to the tunnels beneath the city, where they would be safe from the Dreadhorde.\n\nAfter that, Vraska, Ral, Kaya, Teyo, and Araithia journeyed to [[Rix Maadi]] to negotiate with [[Rakdos]].<ref name=\"Desperation\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/war-spark-ravnica-operation-desperation-2019-06-05|War of the Spark: Ravnica – Operation Desperation|[[Greg Weisman]]|June 5, 2019}}</ref> The demon lord was initially hostile due to the death of his emissary [[Hekara]], and the blood witch [[Exava]] ordered the group to leave. However, the Orzhov representative [[Tomik]] showed up with Hekara's corpse, and the Rakdos cultists resurrected Hekara as a blood witch. After defeating Exava in a fight, Hekara used her newfound authority as a blood witch to lead the Rakdos against Bolas.\n\nOnce all ten guilds were on board, Nissa performed a ritual at the ruins of the Embassy of Guildpact: with the help of a representative from each guild, she was able to repair the leylines that empowered the [[Living Guildpact]] (which had been disrupted when Bolas destroyed the Guildpact Chamber by opening his portal there). Kaya served as the representative for the Orzhov Syndicate.<ref name=\"Desperation\"/> Using a device that [[Niv-Mizzet]] had constructed before his death to preserve his consciousness, they were able to resurrect Niv and grant the power of the Living Guildpact to him. Niv came back to life just in time to save the others from the [[God]]-Eternal [[Kefnet]]: using his newfound power, Niv was able to completely incinerate Kefnet in a torrent of flame, although the strain of channeling enough energy to kill a god caused him to fall unconscious.\n\nKaya survived the battle and was present during the <c>Planewide Celebration</c> that followed. Seeking to atone for her past mistakes, she joined [[the Gatewatch]].<ref><c>Oath of Kaya</c></ref><ref name=\"Forsaken\"/><ref name=\"Ashes\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/war-spark-ravnica-ashes-2019-06-12|War of the Spark: Ravnica – Ashes|[[Greg Weisman]]|June 12, 2019}}</ref> Later, she was confronted by Niv-Mizzet and the other guildmasters (with Tomik now representing the Orzhov Syndicate in her place). They decided to spare the planeswalkers who formerly worked with Bolas but defected before the battle, on the condition that they make amends by hunting down the planeswalkers who stayed loyal to Bolas or defected too late. As her penance, Kaya was assigned the task of assassinating Liliana Vess, whom the guildmasters had condemned to death for killing thousands of Ravnican citizens with the Dreadhorde.<ref name=\"Ashes\"/>\n\n===The hunt for Liliana===\n[[File:Oath of Kaya.jpg|alt=|thumb|211x211px|<c>Oath of Kaya</c> - ''“So everyone gets what they truly deserve, I will keep watch.”'']]\nStill bound by the debt contracts she inherited from the Obzedat, Kaya contemplated declaring all those debts forgiven. But she knew that such an act would destroy the Orzhov, and feared that the delicate balancing act that was Ravnica would topple with it. The contracts also prevented her from planeswalking away.<ref name=\"Forsaken\" /> However, Tomik Vrona discovered a legal loophole that allowed Kaya to temporarily transfer her Orzhov contracts and guild responsibilities to him. With Tomik now the acting guildmaster, Kaya was free to planeswalk away for short periods, and so Kaya and her entourage along with [[Jaya Ballard]] set out on their quest. Kaya used her necro-magic abilities to envelope and transport Rat on their journey. The group first traveled to [[Gobakhan]] to help Teyo Verada, as it was his first time to intentionally planeswalk. Afterward, Jaya guided them to [[Caligo Morass|Caligo]] on [[Dominaria (plane)|Dominaria]] in search of Liliana but soon left after refusing to go further. \n\nLiliana was found outside the House of Vess working in a nearby garden and in a trance. While Rat went off to learn more about the mansion and its inhabitants, Teyo attempted to remove the gold collar from Liliana's neck which jolted her back to her senses. Liliana fought against Kaya and Teyo but was knocked unconscious by Rat. They discovered that an imposter Liliana Vess controlled the estate by wearing a choker with a blue sapphire amulet that contained a large and very powerful [[djinn]]. Liliana regained consciousness and agreed to let Kaya kill her in exchange for defeating her imposter and freeing her people. \n\nDuring the fight, Rat stole the sapphire amulet and destroyed it which released the djinn named [[Zahid]]. Seeking vengeance, Zahid attempted to kill Teyo who had been using his shield magic to contain the entity. While Rat retrieved the [[Spirit-Gem]] and returned it to Liliana, Kaya tried to kill the djinn but was knocked across the room. Liliana then used the [[Chain Veil]] to subdue Zahid whose only request was to take Liliana Vess as his prisoner. Realizing Zahid was referring to the imposter, Liliana agreed, but Kaya killed the mistress out of mercy. Zahid was forced to leave empty-handed.\n\nAfter the conflict, Liliana answered Kaya's questions and was allowed to live, although proof of a kill would be needed. Teyo suggested that Liliana give up the Veil, who reluctantly did so with a little help from the Spirit-Gem. Before returning to Ravnica, Kaya and her entourage promised to meet Liliana in Paliano on [[Fiora]]. Teyo used his shield magic to transport the Veil and delivered it as proof of Liliana's death.\n\nAs promised, Kaya, Teyo, and Rat traveled to Fiora and met with Liliana who had changed her name to Ana Iora. There they began to help Ana on her path to redemption. Asked where they would go next, Kaya explained that she had unfinished business on her homeworld of Tolvada.<ref name=\"Forsaken\"/>\n\n===Kaldheim===\nA well-paying anonymous (later revealed as [[Tezzeret]]) employer hired Kaya to hunt a hazardous monster on [[Kaldheim (plane)|Kaldheim]] that had already destroyed the plane. This monster turned out to be none other than [[Vorinclex]], one of New Phyrexia's praetors.<ref name=\"Travelers\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/episode-1-travelers-2021-01-07|Episode 1: Travelers|[[Roy Graham]]|January 8, 2021}}</ref> She joined up with [[Inga Rune-Eyes]], the leader of the Omenseekers faction of humans on the realm of Bretagard and her crew.

Tibalt set both the Hagi and Torga trolls up against her, and she only escaped them with the help of the just arriving [[Tyvar Kell]]. Meanwhile, Tibalt escaped, by creating an [[omenpath]] with the [[Sword of the Realms]].\n\nThe pair followed Tibalt to [[Immersturm]] where they were accosted by a couple of [[demon]]s. Because of this, they were unable to prevent Tibalt from creating a [[Doomskar]] before they managed to take the sword from him. Led by [[Varragoth]], thousands of demons streamed through a giant rift in space to attack another realm. Kaya felt defeated, but Tyvar persuaded her to stay and fight.<ref name=\":2\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/episode-4-demons-realm-2021-01-27|Episode 4: Into the Demon's Realm|[[Roy Graham]] and [[Jenna Helland]]|January 27, 2021}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Bretagard]], Kaya, Tyvar, and the leaders of the Clans were advised by [[Alrund]] to take the [[Sword of the Realms]] to [[Halvar]], so that the [[god]] of battle could end the [[Doomskar]]. Mounted on a [[giant]] [[bird|raven]], Kaya, Tyvar, and [[Arni]] flew toward [[Halvar]], but near the destination, they were attacked in midair by the [[demon]] [[Varragoth]] who wanted the Sword for himself. Kaya used her powers to save her companions from death, but they ended up falling close to the Dread Marn, [[Karfell]]'s army. Arni stayed behind to slow the [[zombie]]s while the two [[Planeswalker (lore)|planeswalkers]] took the Sword. In the middle of the way, Tyvar heard the sound of the horn of [[Skemfar]]'s army and separated from Kaya to warn his brother of what was happening.\n\nAfter separating from the elf, Kaya was attacked by Varragoth but was saved by [[Cosima]]. Even with the efforts of the [[god]], the demon was only delayed. During the battle, Kaya saw [[Koma]] enter into [[Bretagard]] after being expelled from [[Starnheim]] by the [[angel|Valkyries]] and [[Niko Aris]]. The [[Cosmos]] [[Serpent]] was responsible for closing [[Karfell]]'s [[Omenpath]] and destroying several [[Zombie|draugr]] (accidentally). At that moment, the Valkyries and Niko also arrived in Bretagard. Niko and Kaya ended up saving each other's lives during the battle. Near the location of Halvar, Kaya was attacked once again by Varragoth but was saved by the [[elf|elves]]. While Tyvar and the army of elves fought the [[demon]]s and [[zombie]]s, [[Harald]] helped Kaya to reach Halvar. Tyvar used his transmuting powers to strengthen his allies and hinder opponents and tried as hard as possible to stop Varragoth, but the demon was only stopped by Kaya who cut the demon's throat with one of the axes Tyvar had made for her.\n\nAfter the great battle and the end of the [[Doomskar]], Tyvar met Kaya and praised her for killing Varragoth and promised that the skalds would not forget any detail of this feat when telling this [[saga]]. He told Kaya that he was now ready to walk the [[Multiverse]] and help those in need on other [[plane]]s. Kaya met with [[Sigrid]], [[Inga Rune-Eyes|Inga]], [[Arni]], [[Fynn]], [[Niko Aris|Niko]] and [[Harald]] after the battle. Sigrid told her they would have a lot of work to hunt down the invaders that remained in Bretagard. Harald and the leaders of the Clans agreed that [[elf|elves]] and [[human]]s must live in peace until the elves manage to return to [[Skemfar]]. Inga asked about [[Vorinclex|the monster]] Kaya was hunting and Kaya replied that he must be in other [[Plane|realms far away]]. Realizing that Kaya was a planeswalker, Niko approached her to speak further.<ref name=\":The Battle\">{{DailyRef|magic-story/episode-5-battle-kaldheim-2021-02-03|Episode 5: The Battle for Kaldheim|[[Roy Graham]]|February 03, 2021}}</ref>\n\n===Midnight Hunt===\n[[File:Thraben Exorcism.jpg|thumb|205x205px|Kaya exorcises the Betzold family mansion so that her companions can enter.|alt=]]\n[[Arlinn Kord]] goes to [[Ravnica]] to ask [[The Gatewatch]] for help in finding the [[Moonsilver Key]].

The city was destroyed and full of [[zombie]]s (the army [[Liliana Vess|Liliana]] used against [[Emrakul]]). Kaya entered the city alone to scout the place. She found a clue in a book about the whereabouts of the [[Moonsilver Key]]. The Key should be in the possession of the Betzold family. Arlinn and Adeline knew a [[cleric|bishop]] of the [[Church of Avacyn]] with that last name. They located bishop [[Worrin Betzold]] amid the ruins of a church. The group made their way through the zombies until they reached the bishop. Arlinn interrogated the zombie bishop and was given a name, ''Dennick''. The group moved to [[Gavony]], where the family had a mansion. They discover, when talking to an old lady, that the mansion is haunted. Kaya entered the ruins alone and killed the ghosts of the place until she found the [[spirit]] of [[Dennick Betzold]], who told the group the location of the Key. The Key had been given by an ancestor of Dennick to [[Sorin Markov]]. At Markov Manor, Teferi and Arlinn waited with Sorin for the [[vampire]] to hand over the Key so they could help restore balance to Innistrad. The vampire refused and attacked Arlinn when she mentioned [[Avacyn]]. The second time Sorin would strike, [[Sigarda]] appeared, answering a prayer made by the group before entering the Manor, and stopped the attack. The [[angel]] says that the Key is in Sorin's quarters and that she will stop the vampire giving the group a chance to get the Key.<ref name=\"Betzold\"/> \n[[File:Kaya Geist Hunter Variant.jpg|left|thumb|Breaking into [[Olivia Voldaren]]'s wedding to retrieve the [[Moonsilver Key]].|251x251px|alt=]]\n\nThe party returned to the [[Celestus]] in possession of the Key.

However, battling fellow planeswalkers had left him weak enough for Lim-Dûl to attack and kill him while protecting [[Bani Bakur]].<ref name=\"Shandalar comic\">[[David Quinn]] (1996), \"''[[Shandalar (comic)|Shandalar]]''\", [[Armada]]</ref> However, his body merely disappeared as his being escaped, and so he was not dead, though his followers thought he was (for which they beheaded Lim-Dûl). Whilst he was not dead, he had been left weakened by Lim-Dûl's opportunistic attack, having nearly no magic left.\n\n===[[Lim-Dûl's War]]===\n12 years later Lim-Dûl (who had also managed to not die) started conquering Shandalar with an army of undead in [[Lim-Dûl’s War]]. Since Sahrmal had been weakened, he had been training two adepts to take his place and face Lim-Dûl. One, whose original name is unknown, would later become known as [[The Guardian]], and the other was [[Azar]]. City after city on the plane was destroyed until, after years of war, only one city remained: [[Ardestan]]. Ardestan became the last refuge, the last protection, against the evil necromancer. The city came under siege and it was plain to all that Shandalar would soon fall to this invader. Sahrmal counseled patience, telling his students that they were not yet ready to take on the might of Lim-Dûl. But Azar, was unable to witness the suffering and inevitable fall of the city without doing something left their hidden sanctuary to defend it. Upon learning of this rash action, Sahrmal and his other apprentice went to his aid.\n\nAzar had stolen a spell from Sahrmal designed to target the necromancer’s spirit and imprison it within his body, drawing power from it to erect a [[Great Barrier]] around Shandalar. Lim-Dûl was prepared, however, and waited nearby. He planned to transfer his spirit into Azar’s body. When Azar’s spell was complete, Lim-Dûl initiated his counter. The combined spells had the unforeseen effect of trapping both spirits within Azar’s body. The body went limp as the two souls warred for control. \n\n===Finding a successor===\nSaddened, Sahrmal secretly buried the body, for the [[Great Barrier]] had come into existence and it depended upon the confinement of Lim-Dûl. Meanwhile, the other student finished his training. Sahrmal, investing the last of his powers, made his pupil immortal. Then, Sahrmal proclaimed the student as his successor and vanished. The student proclaimed to the world, “I am the Guardian, immortal protector of Shandalar.”\n\nWhether transferring the last of his powers whilst in a still weakened state killed Sahrmal is unknown as is what would happen to him if it did not.\n\n==Story appearances==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

He can turn his stony armor white-hot as he activates it and feed heat into metal.<ref name=\"Losses\"/>\n\n==History==\n===Ascension===\nKoth was born as a member of the Hammer tribe, though his parents hailed from two different tribes, making him what is known as an ''alloy'' among the vulshok. His planeswalker spark ignited when the tribes of his once peaceful people fell into open war for the first time in generations. The metal they had traditionally mined from the mountains of the [[Oxidda Chain]] became strangely corrupted; the ingots forged by the Anvil tribe turned brittle and inconsistent.<ref name=\"Human\"/> Each tribe blamed the others for the weakness of their sacred ore and old hatred began to reemerge. Koth believed he could use his ability to purify the ore, and with Koth's help, the solidity of the metal was restored and the skirmishes between tribes slowed. \n\n===Gathering Forces===\n[[File:Koth2.jpg|thumb|Koth's Powers|266x266px]]\nWhen the Phyrexian corruption invading Mirrodin became obvious, he branded their insignia on his arm as a promise to his people to save them.<ref name=\"Gathering Forces\">[[Jenna Helland]] (2010), \"''[[Gathering Forces]]''\", [[Wizards of the Coast]]</ref> So began his planeswalking journey. A mysterious man pointed Koth towards Urborg and [[Martyrs' Tomb|The Heroes' Memorial]], where the sages helped him, though initially, they distrusted him. While on Urborg, he entered the gladiatorial pits where he fought [[Elspeth Tirel]]. He refused to fight back, but when Elspeth saw the mark of Phyrexia on his arm after a lucky strike, she tried to kill him in a blind rage. She was stopped by the timely intervention of [[Ajani Goldmane]] who had come looking for Elspeth. Soon afterward, Koth told Elspeth of the Phyrexian invasion taking hold of the plane.\n\nTogether the next morning, Koth took Elspeth to a ruined structure called The Tomb of Flesh. They talked of their homes, of the places they cherished, and once more Elspeth lamented Bant's fate. Koth used his geomancy to create a bridge of stepping stones to the tomb, using his demonstration as a chance to offer wise counsel to the tortured young woman. Elspeth conjured a light once they reached the entrance of the tomb. Koth saw nothing within the ruin but Elspeth, terrified and chilled, fled from the dark corners of the world only she can see. \n\nKoth found her once more at the ruins of a castle and asked her to come with him to The Heroes' Memorial. Once there, he gifted her with gems, telling her to trap her fear in them, but she simply said that the past is not so easily forgotten. Here in the temple, Koth communed with the stone altar and learned only one thing: They must find a man named [[Venser]]. The artificer was not hard to find, being a long-standing target for [[Windgrace Acolytes]] who tended the memorial. The pair went to see Venser, and Koth was shocked to find a Phyrexian vessel being rebuilt, improved in fact, to act as a planeshifting ship. When it became obvious that Venser had no idea of the powers he was meddling with, Koth flew into a rage and encased his head in a stone mask, coercing him to walk to Mirrodin. Venser needed to see the threat he was unwittingly toying with and what it had done to Koth's home, and for that reason, Koth would do anything to make him fight.\n\n===Scarred===\nKoth took his allies to the lands he called home. Despite his dire warnings, the pair saw nothing particularly threatening, and Venser continued his tirade against the geomancer. Koth broke off his argument with Venser long enough to tell the foreigners of the conflicts raging across the surface, and of the dark threat that corrupts the plane itself. Koth used his power to ferry the pair across the world in search of an old friend to help him tell them of their true enemy, but what he found was the surprising spread of the [[Mephidross]], stretching farther than he could have expected when he left. The trio found something other than Koth's acquaintance, a shambling corpse that attacked as soon as it sensed the group. The allies quickly fought off the [[nim]], but once again Elspeth became sullen and withdrawn, and with a doleful sigh, she told the arguing walkers that she could not go any further.\n\nUnfortunately, without her warrior's expertise, Venser and Koth fell quickly to a <c>Corrupted Harvester</c> and were dragged back to its lair near [[Ish Sah]]. Koth awoke under harsh lights and strapped to a table next to his reluctant ally. He quickly freed himself, but could not awaken Venser before the Phyrexians came. He valiantly fought them but was overpowered until Elspeth's sudden reappearance. With her help, the trio subdued their captors and proceeded to the Black Lacuna. Venser teleported inside for recon and Koth declared his confidence that it will all be over soon, knowing nothing of the forces massed inside the Vault.\n\n===The Quest for Karn===\n[[File:Koth and Elspeth.jpg|thumb|Koth and Elspeth|258x258px]]\nElspeth, Venser, and Koth traveled to the Vault of Whispers, where they witnessed the emergence of a Phyrexian army that was invading the surface.<ref>[[Doug Beyer]] (2011), \"''[[Scarred]]''\", [[Wizards of the Coast]]</ref> During their observation, Elspeth froze when being in such proximity to the Phyrexians brought back memories of her captivity, and was almost captured. After several hours, the army passed, and the three companions entered the Vault, following a Myr secretly sent by Tezzeret to guide them. It led them to [[Geth]], and in secret, they followed it into the interior of the world. They came upon a butchering room in which they engaged massive Phyrexian butchers. Elspeth slew many, but they were outnumbered and had to flee. They managed to escape further into Mirrodin's underground through a meat shaft. When they emerged from the shaft, they encountered [[Ezuri]], the leader of a band of Mirran rebels. While Venser insisted that they had to continue onward to find Karn, Ezuri said that he could allow them to go no further. He revealed that the Phyrexian invasion had benefited him greatly, catapulting him into a heroic leadership position that he was loath to give up. But when Elspeth threatened Ezuri, and Venser displayed a bit of his magic, the elf backed down and his followers fled. The companions continued further toward Mirrodin's core, eventually being met by Tezzeret.\n\nTezzeret led the companions to a surgery room, where Elspeth, angered by the sight of Phyrexians experimenting on creatures, flew into a rage, slaying all the Phyrexians in the room in a matter of moments. They freed [[Melira]], a Mirran born without any metal on her body, from the cages. Tezzeret said this was his gift to them; she was completely immune to [[phyresis]]. During the subsequent travels, Elspeth grew very protective of Melira. They began traveling back towards the surface but were surrounded and attacked by a massive force of Phyrexians. During the battle, Elspeth was the center of the Phyrexians' attention, slaying most of them and creating piles of dead around her so high that the other companions lost sight of her. \n[[File:Slagstorm Koth Powers.jpg|left|thumb|248x248px|Geomantic Powers.]]\nThe companions eventually reached the furnace layer, where the Phyrexians ignored any Mirran survivors and found Ezuri's rebel camp. There they were welcomed, despite their previous encounter, and Melira's ability to heal phyresis was discovered. She healed all those in the camp that were infected by the [[glistening oil]], healing non-stop for several days while Elspeth sat with her in the tent, speaking to her. Once everyone in the camp was healed, a council was called in which Ezuri, hoping to become more influential, invited Melira to stay with them, while subtly telling the companions to leave. Melira said she would leave with the companions, however, and Elspeth and the others prepared to leave for the core to try to find Karn. While they were leaving, the camp was attacked by Tezzeret's Phyrexians, and the companions found a guide to take them further. They escaped the battle and followed the guide, who only Elspeth trusted. They followed the guide deep into Mirrodin's core, encountering many strange rooms and caverns. At one point they did battle with two strange Phyrexian angels. Elspeth killed one with a throwing knife and the other she decapitated while it attacked Venser. During the battle, Koth got angry at their lack of progress on the surface war, took Melira, and left, leaving Venser and Elspeth alone with the guide. They hurried after Koth but were ambushed by Tezzeret's Phyrexians. \n\nThe Phyrexians carried the Planeswalkers away, but while their captors were trying to figure out how to access a doorway, Koth and Melira reappeared and freed the pair. By the time the Phyrexians realized that their captives were gone, the companions were already running. Venser's strength, however, was wearing thin, and they were forced to stop. He was able to concoct an explosive from the metal on the walls and blow up part of the tunnel, sealing it temporarily, but it was only a matter of time before a group of Phyrexians, led by Glissa, broke through. While she was taunting them, Tezzeret appeared, and his forces did battle with Glissa's, allowing the companions to escape and reach Karn's throne room uninterrupted. There, they found Karn corrupted by the [[Phyrexian oil]]. Melira told the companions that his heart was corrupted. Venser told the others that he was already dying and had been for years and that he was unlikely to last much longer. With his last strength, Venser gave his life and spark to Karn, curing the golem. Cured and lucid once again, Karn spoke with Elspeth, who told him that he could not kill all the Phyrexians. Karn replied that he knew, and that is why he needed their help; He asked them to begin organizing and leading the resistance with Melira to try to cleanse Mirrodin, no matter how long it would take. With purpose, and ready for the long battle ahead, the group left the throne room and headed back toward the surface to begin their war.\n\n===Mirrodin Falls===\n[[File:Phyrexian Arena - Koth.jpg|thumb|252x252px|Surviving the Phyrexian Arena.]]\nUnfortunately, nothing could stem the tide. The resistance only survived because of the infighting between the praetors, but this respite could not last. Slowly, [[Elesh Norn]] gained more influence, even in the furnace layers, effectively conquering [[Urabrask]]'s and [[Sheoldred]]'s domains. The resistance learned that the praetors, along with the traitorous Tezzeret, prepared to gather in the throne room to select a new Mother of Machines (Or Father.) It was very possibly the last chance to strike out at the praetors, and make a final show of defiance, no matter how hollow. Elspeth and Koth took a large force to attack the praetors with a very powerful spellbomb, preparing to make a final stand. However, the mission was compromised almost as soon as it began. They fought valiantly but lost warriors in great numbers while the Phyrexian hordes seemed endless. At last, Elspeth and Koth were the only two left, having made it to the heart of Norn's domain. Koth erected rudimentary defenses and prepared to set off the bomb, ready to sacrifice himself... but was not ready for Elspeth to die with him.\n\nHe told her to go, but she did not budge, so he used his magic to sink her into the ground and create a shield against the blast, giving her only one option to escape. She planeswalked away as the spellbomb detonated, leaving Koth's final fate unknown to her. Koth escaped alive into the bowels of the furnace layers.<ref>{{WebRef|url=https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/checking-planeswalkers-2014-06-16|title=Checking in on the Planeswalkers|author=[[Doug Beyer]]|date=June 17, 2014|work=[[magicthegathering.com]]|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20201020035958/https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/checking-planeswalkers-2014-06-16|archivedate=2020-10-20}}</ref> He hopes that the Mirran resistance can one day overthrow the Phyrexians, and works with [[Melira]] to protect those who remain.<ref>[[Mel Li]].

Lingering too long, Vraska succumbed to the Phyrexian influence and infected Jace in turn. The others tried to escape but were quickly overwhelmed by the black Phyrexians. Nahiri, who was also infected, decided to sacrifice herself for the greater good. With a mighty magical blast, she exploded the Coliseum and dropped it with all remaining planeswalkers on the [[Fair Basilica]]. Nearer to their goal, the infected Jace rejoined them and volunteered to bring the [[Sylex]] to the [[Seedcore]].<ref name=\"Losses\"/>\n\nIn the Seedcore, they met [[Karn]] imprisoned.
